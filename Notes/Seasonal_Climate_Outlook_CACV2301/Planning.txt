@planning 

for this FY:
 
[*] **Complete the new tercile / decile / imagery generation for the SCO (leftover from last FY)**

	Now part the real time validation code 
	
	**tercile OK** 
	**quartiles OK** 
	decile ?  
	
[*] **Real-time validation (leftover from last FY)**

[ ] **Monthly-to-seasonal marine heatwave outlooks (methodology consistent with ICU / SCO)**

schedule that in October ahead of the NDJ season (marine heatwave in the works) 

	Probability of exceedence for percentile threshold (using the MME): 
	
		- 80th percentile 
		- 90th percentile 
	
	Deterministic information: 
	
		- how many std from the mean 
		- whether anomalies are exceeding max over the hindcast period 

[*] **Operational task - calculate SST indices (NOAA OISSTv2) with respect to 1991-2020 (cease relying on BoM SST values)**

realtime 

using OISST
