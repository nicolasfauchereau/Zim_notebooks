technologies 

AI and Humans working together (see 'human compatible') 
smart sensors 
IOT 
autonomous drones

especially needed because we are going to have to transition to a scarcity economy: wastages of resources (food, water, energy) cannot be tolerated anymore)  

huge potential for ethical AI in a solarpunk future: good at ingesting and making sense of a huge amount of data, good at optimizing processes (caveat: one really needs to think deeply about what we are optimizing for and the side effects of this: provide AI with the right 'incentives')

each community has its (group of) expert(s) on: 

+ decentralized communication networks and platforms (decentralized web, peer to peer, beaker browser, dat: protocol, scuttlebutt social network) 
+ data scientist

===== AI to speak for the trees =====

The lorax project: build an AI that 'speaks for the trees': i.e. each recognizable ecosystem has legal personhood, and an AI 'represents' them with regards to any decision that is made ... 

Eco-historical regions 

communities are organized along lines corresponding to identifiable eco-historical regions, respecting indigeneous demarcations
