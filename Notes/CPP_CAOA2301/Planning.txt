Drew: 

The tasks for this year for CAOA, in this order, will be: 

1.) PICT codes completed and fully tested (with work completed by 30 Sept), 

2.) Fundamental Data Page updates (only a couple more things to do on your end, will be flexible between now and 15 Dec), 

3.) Once daily synoptic type paper on modes of variability (analyses begin 1 October, writing completed 15 Dec)) 

4.) BAMS SOTC section on ITCZ (due end of January 2023), 

5.) Once daily synoptic type paper on predictability (remaining time this FY put into framing that and working on it with me). 

We are also through the short list for the MBIE endeavour fund bid, so I will co opt some of your time to help on that - EOI due in November or December I think
