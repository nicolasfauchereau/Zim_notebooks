==== Project LORAX ====

"(A)I speaks for the trees": 

Legal personhood has been granted to rivers etc 

Guardians - indigeneous people - represent the interest of these legal persons 

Can be assisted by Smart Monitoring, holistic 

Can be scaled to other ecosystems and natural entities where human representation is not possible, too difficult ... transform data into 

define range of parameters measuring environmental degradation, what are the limits, the boundaries, what are the non-linearities, 

"Fantastic Fungi": Nature is intelligent and speaks a language, we need to understand this language ...

==== Auckland cycling and weather ====

comparison between the 'old' data and the 'new' updated data, see **compare_cycling_data_old_updated.ipynb** in [[/home/nicolasf/research/Auckland_cycling_NeuralProphet/notebooks]] 

shows that for 2017 there are some disprecancies between the 'old' and the 'new' data, the new data shows a large gap at the beginning of 2017 for Tamaki Drive EB, which is not present in the 'old' data, see below 

{{./screenshot_2020-12-24-105326.png}}

so the solution would be to replace the 'new' data by the old data for 2017 .... 

for 2018, the correlation over the overlapping period is 1 for both Tamaki Drive EB and WB ....

we can then update everything to include all data to **2019-01-30 21:00 **when the EWS 22719 was discontinued ... 

NOTE: the data that Petra provided for Mangere EWS is definitely NOT the same as the data provided by Neelesh ... 

see notebook **compare_old_and_new_data.ipynb** in [[/home/nicolasf/research/Auckland_cycling_2019/notebooks]]

the difference between e.g. mean temperature can be huge ... ha ha i**t's because one is given in UTC, and the other in NZST** ... 

add 12 hours to the time in the data Neelesh has extracted ! 

see now in the folder '**/home/nicolasf/research/Auckland_cycling_2019/notebooks**' which will contain all the data (cycling and weather) updated to the January 2019 (but not after, as the wind data has some issues related to change of instruments) 

== Solution for early next year: ==

1) Take all the 'OLD' cycling data up to August 2018, then add the updated data for the rest of 2018 and 2019-01 
2) Take the 'new' weather data, possibly investigating the possibility of using alternative agent numbers from the data recently extracted by Neelesh, and available in [[/home/nicolasf/drives/auck_scratch/fauchereaun/cycling_data]] 
3) apply a positive timedelta of 12 hours to the new weather data ...
