Note that the CMORPH dataset is actually downloaded initially from the KNMI climate explorer ... 

The notebooks translating Brett's code from IDL to Python are in

* plot_monthly_maps.ipynb plots the lat / lon maps (monthly averages, anomalies and anomalies in percentage of normal) 
* plot_sectors.ipynb plots the longitudinal sector plots
