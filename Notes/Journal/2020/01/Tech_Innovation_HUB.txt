=== AI / ML ===

talk about opportunities and also danger of falling for the hype, navigating and assessing vendors' claims 

open source platforms and frameworks, from WEKA to TF to Pytorch and lately JAX .. ML at scale 

also concerns about the actual environment impacts of AI: https://www.wired.com/story/ai-great-things-burn-planet/ 

see https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10597: Green AI, "The computations required for deep learning research have been doubling every few months, resulting in an estimated 300,000x increase from 2012 to 2018 [2]. These computations have a surprisingly large carbon footprint [38]. Ironically, deep learning was inspired by the human brain, which is remarkably energy efficient. Moreover, the financial cost of the computations can make it difficult for academics, students, and researchers, in particular those from emerging economies, to engage in deep learning research.
This position paper advocates a practical solution by making efficiency an evaluation criterion for research alongside accuracy and related measures. In addition, we propose reporting the financial cost or "price tag" of developing, training, and running models to provide baselines for the investigation of increasingly efficient methods. Our goal is to make AI both greener and more inclusive---enabling any inspired undergraduate with a laptop to write high-quality research papers. Green AI is an emerging focus at the Allen Institute for AI.""" 

what is the carbon footprint of our HPC for example, has it been quantified or evaluated ?

=== How the climate and ecological emergency will reshape our future as an organization: ===

For instance, clean energy isn't just the oil industry but with wind turbines. It's a different industry, entirely.

Millions of people have expertise grounded entirely in the systems being replaced.

As disruption happens, that expertise loses value, fast—and no one wants to be on the receiving end of a "rapid repricing" in their career.

financial opportunities 

VC are now actively looking into 'climate tech', see Tommy Lees, Sequoia Capital is saying: 

"We @Sequoia
 are actively investing in Climate Tech and Sustainability (more to come). Why? Because it is both our responsibility and a huge business opportunity (h/t @karaswisher
). We’d love to hear from more Climate Tech entrepreneurs:

=== AI / ML in weather and climate forecasting ===

see https://www.ecmwf.int/en/about/media-centre/news/2019/what-next-machine-learning-weather-forecasting 

huge amount of observations (600 M every day coming in NWP) 
opportunities for HPC (parametrisations ?) 
workflows in NWP: 
	
	
	=== observations ===
	
		weather data monitoring 
		realtime QC 
		anomaly interpretation 
		data fusion from different sources 
		correction of observation error
	
	
	=== data assimilation ===
		
		learn giverning differential equations 
		non-linear bias correction 
		bias prediction 
		learn operational operators 
		define optical properties of hydrometeors and aerosols 
		emulate conventional tools to improve efficiency 
		
	
	
	=== NWP ===
	
		+ emulate model components 
		+ parametrisations 
		+ build better error models 
		+ learn the underlying equations of motion 
		+ generate tangent linear or adjoint code from machine learning emulators
	 
	
	=== post-processing and dissemination  ===
	
		+ realtime adjustments of forecast products
		+ feature detection 
		+ uncertainty quantification 
		+ error corrections for seasonal predictions 
		+ development of low complexity models 
		+ bespoke products for business opportunities (downstream of NWP forecasts) learn relationships between weather and business metrics 
		
		
	=== Applications cases:  ===
	
		+ detect the risk for the ignition of wild fires by lightning 
		+ bias correct the forecast model in 4D var assimilation 
		+ analyse soil moisture from SMOS observation 
		+ NWP: emulate radiation scheme with NNs (cheaper) 
		+ post-processing and dissemination: 
			+ correct ensemble spread calculated from a small number of ensemble members via deep learning 
			+ ecPoint to post-process rainfall rainfall predictions (basically: improve local rainfall predictions, using decision trees) = earlier and more consistent signal with higher probabilities
