work on the BAMS codes in the morning, finished all code, pushed to github at

**NOTE:** 

==== MATPLOTLIB COLORMAPS ====

for **diverging colormaps with center NOT AT ZERO**, Matplotlib version > 3.1 has introduced a new function called `**DivergingNorm**`

to use: 

vmin = 0
vmax = 400 

mid_point = 100 # e.g. if in % 

from matplotlib import colors
norm = colors.DivergingNorm(vmin=vmin, vcenter=mid_point, vmax=vmax) 

then call e.g. ax.contourf(..., cmap=cmap, norm=norm)

or 

TwoSlopeNorm
