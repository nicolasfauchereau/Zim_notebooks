==== Risk of late frost in a warmer climate ====

https://github.com/steidani/climate/tree/master/copernicus_frost 

Frost occurence (FD) after warm period exceeding a certain amount of Growing Degree Days (GDD). 

Agroclimatic indicators from 1981 - 2010 (historical) and 2017 - 2099 (RCP6 future scenario):

	→ Biologically effective degree days (GDD): Sum of daily mean temperatures (TG) above 10°C and less than 30°C, over 10 days.
	→ Frost Days (FD): Number of days per 10 days when TN $<$ 0°C, where TN is the daily minimum temperature. This indicator provides information on frost damage.
