==== process to derive regional time-series from VCSN ====


1) process_VCSN_monthly_daily_ops.ipynb in [[~/operational/VCSN/notebooks]]
2) calculates_6_regions_terciles_from_grid.ipynb in [[/home/nicolasf/research/Smart_Ideas/code/targets/VCSN]] 

NOTE: **calculates_6_regions_percentiles_from_grid_regionmask.ipynb** is the new version of the notebook, using regionmask to calculate the regional time-series ... the results are almost to the previous versions, which used https://github.com/fmaussion/salem 

at the end of the notebook, a little piece of code compares the previous calculations (using salem), with the new calculations (using regionmask)

see also updated version of **make_region_mask.ipynb** uncd

==== experiments with using forecast SST as predictors, for the Apple and Pears application cases ====

see **Apple_and_Pears_concat_ensemble_mean.ipynb**

→ cannot use the `sample` method of a dataframe to extract train and test set, as it does not guarantee the same values will not be present 
in both train and test set 

→ the `train_test_split` function of scikit-learn works directly on pandas dataframes, so 

train_df, test_df = train_test_split(df) 

returns dataframes 

--------------------

==== experiments with using SST and SST EOFs as predictors ====

**Apple_and_Pears_SSTs_obs.ipynb** in 

[[/home/nicolasf/research/Smart_Ideas/code/models/application_cases/classification/Apple_and_Pears/AutoML/AUTOGLUON/notebooks]] 

with accuracies for rainfall **~ 0.6 **(cross validated using AutoGluon)

try with prior detrend next
