==== derive other quantiles for the application cases (5 quantiles) ====

process: 

1) take time-series, derive quantiles 

**calculate_quantiles_categories.ipynb** in e.g. 

[[/home/nicolasf/research/Smart_Ideas/code/targets/application_cases/Apple_and_Pears/notebooks]] 

2) glue together with the ECMWF GCM data 

see: 

**prepare_GCMs_to_CSV_application_cases.ipynb** 

in

[[/home/nicolasf/research/Smart_Ideas/code/engineer/notebooks]] 

3) evaluate tree-based and ensemble methods 

see 

**Apple_and_Pears_tree_based_classifiers_retrain.ipynb**    

in  [[/home/nicolasf/research/Smart_Ideas/code/models/application_cases/classification/Apple_and_Pears/ExtraTrees/notebooks]] 

these are the typical accuracy scores for the different classifiers, for the quintiles categories 

KNN                           		0.291667
**SVC                          	   0.625000**
NuSVC                         		0.375000
DecisionTreeClassifier        	0.312500
RandomForestClassifier        	0.395833
AdaBoostClassifier            	0.312500
GradientBoostingClassifier    	0.250000
ExtraTreesClassifier          	0.416667

Support Vector Classifier, with** SVC(kernel="rbf", C=0.025, probability=True)** 

Note that using the parameter class_weight='balanced' leads to huge performance decrease ... the SVC accuracy is degraded to **0.16 !**

==== New version of climpred ====

see release notes here 

https://climpred.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ 

and blog post 

https://medium.com/@rileybrady/climpred-verification-of-weather-and-climate-forecasts-dd88333942d9 

summary of the changes: 


→ [[https://climpred.readthedocs.io/en/stable/bias_removal.html|An early implementation of bias correction.]]
→ Spatial dimensions can now be used in metric calls, e.g. for pattern correlation.
→ New metrics have been added from xskillscore, which are mostly based on the Contingency table. We have also added additional probability metrics: the ranked probability score, reliability, discrimination, and ranked histogram.
→ Math operations can be used between PredictionEnsemble objects (see example [[https://climpred.readthedocs.io/en/stable/prediction-ensemble-object.html#Arithmetic-Operations-with-PredictionEnsemble-Objects|here]]).
→ Users can now quick plot their prediction system (if there are no spatial dimensions) with plot(). See an example of this in the quick start.

==== transfer entropy and information flow between 2 time-series ====

see paper in Nature on the relationship between Total Solar Irradiance and Ocean Heat Content 

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-74331-2#Sec7 

The concept of **Transfer Entropy** is a non-symmetrical extension of the Multual Information (MI) concept, some implementations can be found here: 

→ https://github.com/lcdm-uiuc/PyIF An open source implementation to compute bi-variate Transfer Entropy. 
→ https://github.com/DarkEyes/VLTimeSeriesCausality  (in R)
→ https://github.com/pwollstadt/IDTxl: The Information Dynamics Toolkit xl (IDTxl) is a comprehensive software package for efficient inference of networks and their node dynamics from multivariate time series data using information theory. 
→ https://github.com/marcbrittain/Transfer_Entropy in Python

==== IDEA: for the forecast of e.g. number of days below / above threshold ====

I do not actually forecast the time-series of these parameters directly: I can just forecast the category (preferentially quintiles ?) then give the distribution of the number of days below / above threshold for the predicted category 

see notebook: 

**stratify_by_category.ipynb** in
