==== glue together the GCMs and the application cases anomalies and category timeseries ====

see in 

[[~/research/Smart_Ideas/code/engineer/notebooks]]

**prepare_GCMs_to_CSV_application_cases.ipynb** 


--------------------

==== Try ExtraTrees classifier on the Apple and Pears categorical data ====

see: 

**Apple_and_Pears_tree_based_classifiers.ipynb**
**Apple_and_Pears_tree_based_classifiers_retrain.ipynb ⇒** retraining yields good scores (87% accuracy !) with evaluation starting NDJ 2016 

e.g. training is done using:

→  data up to JAS 2015 and evaluating on NDJ 2016 
→  data up to ASO 2015 and evaluating on DJF 2016 
→ data up to SON 2015 and evaluating on JFM 2016 


different classifiers accuracry score calculated over the predictions from 2016-01 to 2019-12 

KNN                           		0.562500
**SVC                           	   0.958333**
NuSVC                        		0.645833
DecisionTreeClassifier        	0.562500
**RandomForestClassifier     0.875000**
AdaBoostClassifier            	0.645833
GradientBoostingClassifier    	0.645833
**ExtraTreesClassifier          0.875000**

One can then avarege the class probability across the different classifiers, if done, the accuracy score for the majority vote between the different classifiers is **0.77**

→ uses the ensemble mean 
→ uses repeated stratified k-fold cross validation 
→ try and write one version with monthly re-training 

--------------------

==== move all the CSVs joining GCMs and target variables ====

in 

**/home/nicolasf/research/Smart_Ideas/outputs/targets/application_cases/{application}/Join_GCM_targets**

--------------------

==== concatenate Z500 and target variables for the application case ====

check that the Z500 variable has been processed, see: 

**process_ECMWF_nc_downloads.ipynb** in [[/home/nicolasf/research/Smart_Ideas/code/processors/CDS/notebooks]] 

all seasonal and monthly anomalies should be saved in the folder
