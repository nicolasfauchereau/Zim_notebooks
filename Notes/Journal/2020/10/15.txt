==== Observational indices ====

all observational indices (NINO3.4, EMI, IOD, SAM, SPSD) are saved in 

[[/media/nicolasf/END19101/data/observational_indices/]]

and generated by the respective notebooks in 

[[/home/nicolasf/research/Smart_Ideas/code/observational_indices/notebooks]] 

a single CSV with all the observational indices is contained in file **observational_indices.csv** in [[/media/nicolasf/END19101/data/observational_indices/]]

for experiments using observational indices as predictors, including lagged versions, see e.g.: 

**Apple_and_Pears_tree_based_classifiers_retrain_observational_indices.ipynb** 

in [[/home/nicolasf/research/Smart_Ideas/code/models/application_cases/classification/Apple_and_Pears/ExtraTrees/notebooks]] 

for successive staggering / lagging of time-series dataframes: 

utility function `**stagger.py**` in [[/home/nicolasf/research/Smart_Ideas/code/ml4seas/utils]]

==== AutoGLUON experiments ====

see [[/home/nicolasf/research/Smart_Ideas/code/models/application_cases/classification/Apple_and_Pears/AutoML/AUTOGLUON/notebooks]] 

for target rainfall **cat3** and using Z500 (ECMWF, 1981 -->) as predictors, accuracry, assessed using repeated stratified cross-validation, can reach ~ **0.54**, usually using LightGBMClassifier_STACKER_l0, or weighted_ensemble_k0_l1
