==== comparison of predictability of (e.g.) Apple and Pears with observed (lagged) versus simulated (seasonal climate forecast) SSTs ====

the 2 notebooks: 

1. **Apple_and_Pears_SSTs_obs.ipynb** → using observed SSTs at 4 months lead times → cross validated accuracy is ~ 0.6 
2. **Apple_and_Pears_SSTs_sim.ipynb** → using simulated SSTs at 3 months lead times → cross validated accuracy is ~ 0.5 
3. Apple_and_Pears_SSTs_obs_tuned.ipynb → using observed SSTs at 4 months lead times + hyperparameters tuning as from https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/tutorials/tabular_prediction/tabular-indepth.html → cross validated accuracy is

== some results, for prediction of RAIN_BC variable ==

using independent test data (post 2016) 

**using observed SST, with 4 months leadtime:** 

accuracy                   		0.566288
accuracy_score             		0.566288
balanced_accuracy_score   	0.564693
matthews_corrcoef          	0.349932

**using observed SST, with 4 months leadtime, and with period restricted to post 1981:** 

accuracy                   		0.582975
accuracy_score             		0.582975
balanced_accuracy_score    	0.582143
matthews_corrcoef         		0.375497

so it goes UP (not down) when restricting the period to match the one at which the GCM forecasts are available 

**using observed SST, with 4 months leadtime, period restricted to post 1981, and staggered SST data up to 6 months:** 

accuracy                   		**0.603512**
accuracy_score             		0.603512
balanced_accuracy_score    	0.602869
matthews_corrcoef          	0.406421

so it goes UP also when including lagged time-series, even if a PCA is performed as part of the pipeline on the staggered data 

**using observed SST, with 4 months leadtime, period restricted to post 1981, staggered SST data up to 6 months, and detrend:** 

accuracy                   		0.590112
accuracy_score             		0.590112
balanced_accuracy_score    	0.588673
matthews_corrcoef         	 	0.388115

**using observed SST, with 4 months leadtime, period restricted to post 1981, and staggered SST data up to 3 months:** 

accuracy                   		0.615895
accuracy_score            	 	0.615895
balanced_accuracy_score    	0.613064
matthews_corrcoef          	0.424992

so it goes UP also when including lagged time-series, even if a PCA is performed as part of the pipeline on the staggered data 


**using observed SST, with 3 months leadtime (i.e. last month would have to be estimated from other sources), and with period restricted to post 1981:**  

accuracy                   		0.579217
accuracy_score             		0.579217
balanced_accuracy_score    	0.577861
matthews_corrcoef          	0.371787

**using simulated SST, with 1 month leadtime (forecasts issued at month 0 for season spanning months +1 to +3)**
