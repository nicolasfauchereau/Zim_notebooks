=== continue experiments with AUTOGLUON ===

using PCs derived from the GCMs instead of the whole grid ... keeping 90% of variance 

NOTE: something weird in the PCs derived from ECMWF T2M for 2018-01 and 2018-02 

example for first PC on the test set 

{{./screenshot_2020-04-07-094133.png?width=500}}

but does actually seem to correspond to some brief period of La Nina like pattern ... (at least in the forecast) 

{{./screenshot_2020-04-07-100230.png?width=500}}

**NOTE**: tried **kernel PCA** but it fails with ARPACK error ...

NOTE: the implementation of kernel PCA by Sebastian Rashka, available as part of the mlxtend libray, seem to NOT FAIL, however the API is significantly different from the sklearn API, e.g. the components (PCs) are obtained after fitting by calling: 

The results using PCA dimensionality reduction are not consistently better than when letting AUTOGLUON do the features engineering itself 

=== domains definition ===

domain_def = {}
domain_def['local'] = [150, 200, -50, -10]
domain_def['regional'] = [90, 300, -65, 50]
**domain_def['ext_regional'] = [70, 300, -70, 60]**
domain_def['global'] = [0, 360, -70, 70]
domain_def['tropics'] = [0, 360, -40, 40]

Now seeing whether PCs derived from the global domain make any difference in terms of overall (cross validated) accuracy as well as SCO accuracy over the test set (last 3 years). 

=== Experiments with PCs derived from different geographical domains ===

== global ==

â†’ the accuracy (on the test set) GOES DOWN when deriving the PCs from the GLOBAL field compared to the REGIONAL field, but the cross-validated accuracy from the predictor leaderboard stay about the same, except for rainfall

e.g. 

for ECMWF, T2M, PCs on global field: SCO ACC on the test set = 0.5

leaderboard: weighted_ensemble_k0_l1	0.666667	0.361728	0.000925	1

for ECMWF, RAIN, PCs on global field: SCO ACC on the test set = 0.27

leaderboard: weighted_ensemble_k0_l1	0.561404	0.348782	0.000815	1

So generally speaking, it seems that the choice of a GLOBAL domain does not improve things 

== tropics ==

e.g. 

for **ECMWF, T2M, PCs on tropics field:** SCO ACC on the test set = 0.69

leaderboard: weighted_ensemble_k0_l1	0.659649	0.383945	0.000782	1

for **ECMWF, RAIN, PCs on tropics field**: SCO ACC on the test set = 0.6111

leaderboard: weighted_ensemble_k0_l1	0.592982	0.332607	0.000770	1

== local ==

e.g. 

for **ECMWF, T2M, PCs on tropics field:** SCO ACC on the test set = 0.77

leaderboard: weighted_ensemble_k0_l1	0.600000	0.404614	0.000810	1

for **ECMWF, RAIN, PCs on tropics field**: SCO ACC on the test set = 0.33

leaderboard: weighted_ensemble_k0_l1	0.508772	0.316729	0.000764	1

== regional ==

e.g. 

for **ECMWF, T2M, PCs on tropics field:** SCO ACC on the test set = **0.75**

leaderboard: weighted_ensemble_k0_l1 0.631579	0.389056	0.000797	1

for **ECMWF, RAIN, PCs on tropics field**: SCO ACC on the test set = **0.61**

leaderboard: weighted_ensemble_k0_l1	0.557895	0.353269	0.000941	1


== ext_regional ==

e.g. 

for **ECMWF, T2M, PCs on tropics field:** SCO ACC on the test set = **0.86**

leaderboard: weighted_ensemble_k0_l1	**0.666667**	0.391695	0.000829	1

for **ECMWF, RAIN, PCs on tropics field**: SCO ACC on the test set = **0.52**

leaderboard: weighted_ensemble_k0_l1	**0.543860**	0.318680	0.000762	1
