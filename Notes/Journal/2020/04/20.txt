== Air pollution and COVID-19 ==

Message from Gus on Slack (NIWA coders): 

"""
The air quality team received a request from colleagues in the UK and Switzerland to collaborate on quantifying the air quality impacts of various COVID-19 control strategies (lock-down levels) using historic meteorological and air quality data to build models to estimate what the air quality would be today if the lock down hadn't been implemented.
They want to do that using random forest and asked us for both data and potentially ML insights ... so ... who would be interested in this?
We have "some" hours through our existing SSIF programme but it's more symbolic than anything but there may be future collaborations around this.
