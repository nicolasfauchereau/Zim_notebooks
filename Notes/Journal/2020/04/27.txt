@TODO 

- Write Eibe re. availability of training and test data on Deuce 
- create channels, and tabs "Key Experts", "Key Activities", "T&I Hubs leads and experts", "Events" 

	the Key activities can be taken from the projects (see in [[/home/nicolasf/HUB/Admin/NIWA_org/pages_on_one.niwa]]) cd
	
	
- organise codes related to the PYCARET and the AUTOGLUON experiments, and start write-up, notably listing all 
the models / algorithms that have been used. See page 17 in HOML2 (instance-based vs model-based learning) 
â†’ convention is that we are going to name the algorithms "learners", and distinguish between instance based and model based learning.
