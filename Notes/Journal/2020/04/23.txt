@TODO : 

- get in touch with P. Blackett

- NZDI: read the Mol et al paper and dig into the code, which is I think on cliops (re-dig into the code I wrote to convert to PCART)

=== PYCARET experimentations ===

updated notebook with prediction and evaluation on test data (2017 - 2019) 

[[/home/nicolasf/research/Smart_Ideas/code/models/classification/autoML/PYCARET/pycaret.ipynb]]

1) that is surprising 
2) this could mean that increasing the number of instances to learn from by using **ALL the members of each ensembles** 
could lead to even better results: @TODO 

Need to describe 'evaluation scores (cross validation on the training data' vs 'test scores' (test period 2017 - 2019
