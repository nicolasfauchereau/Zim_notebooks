==== Experiments with concatenating several GCM to augment the number of instances ====

 [[/home/nicolasf/research/Smart_Ideas/code/models/classification/KNN/KNN_all_GCMs.ipynb]] 

in this notebook, I experiment with retraining the model each month, using each time a training set that includes the last month. 

the features are whatever models are available, concatenated over the time dimension, and the y_hat is taken to be the mode of the prediction for the N repeated time-steps (3 to 5 models depending on the month, as some models only start in 2018 for example. 

The accuracy (true) for the mode forecast, is listed below 

== T2M, all CDS models (available): ==

NNI = 0.81
WNI = 0.68
ENI = 0.81
NSI = 0.73
WSI = 0.72
ESI = 0.69

== PRECIP, all CDS models (available): ==

NNI = 0.53
WNI = 0.57
ENI = 0.57
NSI = 0.62
WSI = 0.57
ESI = 0.58
