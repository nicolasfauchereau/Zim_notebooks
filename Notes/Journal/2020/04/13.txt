@TODO 

== tidying up code for KNN experiments: ==

== ---------------- ==

	- train once / test once, standardization per GCM, use all 11 GCMs
	- train once / test once, standardization per GCM, use all 11 GCms and keep all members of the ensemble  
	- shuffled train and test indices for all of the above 
	- stratified k-fold cross validation 
	- "retrain every month" simulation experiments 


== Saving all forecasts and hindcasts in csv, flattened ==

== Finishing the list of channels and domain experts for the T&I HUB ==




== Calculate quintiles from VCSN for 6 regions, 15 regions and territorial authorities ==

@DONE
