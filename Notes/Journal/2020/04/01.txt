=== fix on the GPM-IMERG download for the ICU ===

see emails from Ben dated 1 April 

The script 

[[/home/nicolasf/operational/ICU/ops/data/GPM_IMERG/daily/scripts/get_daily_GPM_IMERG_netcdf.py]]
 
runs OK, and see 

[[/home/nicolasf/operational/ICU/ops/data/GPM_IMERG/daily/scripts/read_GPM_IMERG.ipynb]] 

for an example of reading and mapping a GPM-IMERG file

=== KNN classification ===

in [[/home/nicolasf/research/Smart_Ideas/code/models/classification/KNN/KNN.ipynb]] 

it seems that, for temperatures 

- choosing just one neighbor is better than choosing a larger number ... 
- choosing the Manhattan distance (p = 1) results in better scores (0.7 accuracy for the NNI)

@TODO 

- make sure there is no data leakage, by putting the EOF step inside a scikit-learn pipeline
- calculate some skill scores instead of just the accuracy score ... 
- fix problem with **inconsistent number of ensemble members** in the METEO_FRANCE forecasts for T2M (25 in the hindcast period, 51 in the forecast period...)
- fix problem with UKMO (inconsistent number of members)
- use a consistent number of members for all GCMs (e.g. 25) 
- CMCC: extra 'month' dimension to be removed in the forecasts 

! often times the forecast period has more members than the hindcast period, therefore need to 
restrict the number of members in the ensemble in the forecast to the number of members in the hindcast
