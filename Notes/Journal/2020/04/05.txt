problem with UKMO pinned down to the fact that 

1) the pre-processed (grib to netcdf) datasets present some spurious "lines" of NaN values for some given latitudes

2) therefore the interpolations fail, and yield some all NaNs fields 
3) on possible solution could be to interpolate the NaNs accross the latitude dimension 
4) a better solution is to re-process all the downloaded forecasts, which are in the "local" folder in 

 [[/home/nicolasf/research/Smart_Ideas/data/GCMs/downloads/forecasts/CDS/UKMO/]]

Note that for T2M it seems that not all months are valid: 2018-01 and 2018-02 seem corrupted 

the notebook "try_fix_ukmo.ipynb" in /home/nicolasf/research/Smart_Ideas/code/processors/CDS/notebooks
 
reads the grib files, fix the attributes and the grid, selects the steps, calculates the monthly anomalies, calculates the seasonal anomalies, 

note: change of grids


interpolate onto the 2x2 grid, then saves all this in the "local" processed folder ...
