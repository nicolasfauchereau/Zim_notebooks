=== extraction of regional anomalies from GCM ===

**CDS:**
	all done ..
**IRI:** 
	**+ NCEP_CFSv2** all done 
	**+ CanCM4i**: ! the hindcasts actually include the period 2017 to 2019: move the years 2017 to 2019 to the forecast folder
	+ **CanSIPSv2**: all done
	+ **GEM_NEMO**: all done
	+ **NASA_GEOSS2S**: all done (note that needed to add a fix to get rid of the extra 'Z' dimension)
**JMA:** 

NOTE: the dimension 'step' is not in the input file as there are no (consistently over the period) leadtimes beyond 3 months ... similarly there are no ensemble members 

ALSO NOTE: the JMA outputs need to be i**nterpolated onto a finer grid (1 X 1)**, or else doesnt work ...
	
	**JMA:** T2M AND PRECIP: something VERY wrong at the end of the period !

The discontinuity is in the first few months of 2015

maybe the values are actually 3 months averages instead of monthly values ...

seems like now on https://ds.data.jma.go.jp/tcc/tcc/gpv/model/CPS2_Hind/monthly 

is available until end of 2019 (2019-12-27) 

The ongoing forecasts are available at:  https://ds.data.jma.go.jp/tcc/tcc/gpv/model/CPS2/3-mon/GPV/202003/

@TODO 

=== Redownload and reprocess everything: hindcasts + first part of the forecasts from ===

https://ds.data.jma.go.jp/tcc/tcc/gpv/model/CPS2_Hind/monthly  

=== then ongoing forecasts from ===

https://ds.data.jma.go.jp/tcc/tcc/gpv/model/CPS2/3-mon/GPV/





 








 
------ 
	
@TODO extract the GCM grid points for the whole of NZ = melt the geometries, do this on a common HIGH RES GRID, not the interpolated grid of JMA, JMA will then be excluded from the analysis 

Note that depending on the model's resolution and grid, one might need to extend the margin to 2 degrees when selecting the subset with salem, e.g. with CanCM4i

{{{code: lang="python" linenumbers="True"
region = dset.salem.subset(shape=shape, margin=2)
}}}


The output (netcdf file) contains only grid points intersecting or inside the NZ multipolygon, and is exported for each GCM and Variable in 

[[/home/nicolasf/research/Smart_Ideas/outputs/targets/GCMs/NZ_shape_grid.]]

see notebook: 

[[/home/nicolasf/research/Smart_Ideas/code/targets/GCM/]]calculates_nz_grid_from_GCM.ipynb 

for the processing ...
