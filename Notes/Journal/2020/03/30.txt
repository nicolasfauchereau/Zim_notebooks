=== WSL new code ===

The extract_GEFS_ops_make_collage.ipynb notebook create the image below {{~/operational/Watercare/notebooks/WSL_15d_forecasts_from_2020-03-29-19-00.png?width=1000}}

Hi JM, Petra

The code, as well as a CSV file collating the previous + supplementary locations are on github in

https://github.com/nicolasfauchereau/Watercare_15d/tree/master/notebooks

The notebook is called:

extract_GEFS_ops_make_collage.ipynb

The csv file is called:

WSL20200330_locations.csv

the file created has file pattern:

WSL_15d_forecasts_from_YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM.png

=== Extraction of the Hunuas and Waitakere ranges daily climate variables and monthly anomalies ===

@SI @VCSN 

see notebook 

Extract_HUNUA_WAITAKERE.ipynb

in [[/home/nicolasf/research/Smart_Ideas/code/targets/application_cases/notebooks]] 

variables extracted: 

'Rain_bc'
'Tmin_N'
'Tmax_N'
'Tmean_N'
'SoilM'
'Wind'
'Rad'

csv files in the same folder as the notebook, e.g. 

Waitakere_ranges_Tmin_N_indices_daily.csv holds the daily Tmin_N values for the Waitakere ranges catchment, the structure of the csv file is

+ **time**: datetime 
+ **INTERSECT**: indice from the grid points contained inside **OR** intersecting with the Waitakere Geometry 
+ **IN**: indice from the grid points **ONLY contained** inside the Waitakere Geometry

=== Extraction of GCM grid for NZ for super-resolution ML experiments ===

@SI @GCM 

notebook: 

**calculates_nz_grid_from_GCMs.ipynb** 

outputs (PRECIP and T2M): 

**HOME / 'research' / 'Smart_Ideas' / 'outputs' / 'targets' / 'GCMs' / 'NZ_shape_grid' / GCM / var_name** 

So far, GCMs processed: 

* **ECMWF**
* **UKMO**
* **METEO_FRANCE**
* **DWD**
* **CMCC **

* **NCEP_CFSv2**
* **CanCM4i**
* **CanSIPSv2**
* **GEM_NEMO **
* **NASA_GEOSS2S**

* **JMA**

Some diagnostics in the same notebook show that the correlation between ensemble members is modest for T2M (e.g. for the whole of NZ average, correlation between members vary between ~ 0.25 and 0.5 

for PRECIP the correlation is extremely low ... varies between ~ -0.1 and 0.2

Hence it is clear that the GCMs fail to represent consistent regional precipitation anomalies, even at the national level 



--------------------

=== Extraction of regional (6 regions) time-series of monthly + seasonal precipitation and temperatures from the VCSN ===

@SI @VCSN 

notebook: 

calculates_6_regions_terciles_from_grid.ipynb 

in [[/home/nicolasf/research/Smart_Ideas/code/targets/VCSN]] 

outputs: 

**HOME / 'research' / 'Smart_Ideas' / 'outputs' / 'targets' / 'NZ_regions' / 'NZ_6_regions'**

* Rain_bc → RAIN → processed OK
* Tmean_N [(Tmin_N + Tmax_N) / 2.] → TMEAN → processed OK
