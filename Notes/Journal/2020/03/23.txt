=== experimentations with xclim ===

see: 

[[/home/nicolasf/research/Smart_Ideas/code/targets/VCSN/calculates_xclim_indices_from_daily_VCSN.ipynb]]

not sure about the calculations of the days above / below a given percentile 

other indices however can be calculated at the grid point scale: 

* dry days: https://xclim.readthedocs.io/en/stable/indices.html#xclim.indices.dry_days
* fraction of total precip due to days over threshold: https://xclim.readthedocs.io/en/stable/indices.html#xclim.indices.fraction_over_precip_thresh
* frost days: https://xclim.readthedocs.io/en/stable/indices.html#xclim.indices.frost_days
* GDD: https://xclim.readthedocs.io/en/stable/indices.html#xclim.indices.growing_degree_days 
* growing season length: https://xclim.readthedocs.io/en/stable/indices.html#xclim.indices.growing_season_length
* Heat Wave Frequency: https://xclim.readthedocs.io/en/stable/indices.html#xclim.indices.heat_wave_frequency
* Heat Wave Index: https://xclim.readthedocs.io/en/stable/indices.html#xclim.indices.heat_wave_index
* Heat Wave Total Length: https://xclim.readthedocs.io/en/stable/indices.html#xclim.indices.heat_wave_total_length
* Hot Spell Frequeny: https://xclim.readthedocs.io/en/stable/indices.html#xclim.indices.hot_spell_frequency
* Maximum consecutive dry days: https://xclim.readthedocs.io/en/stable/indices.html#xclim.indices.maximum_consecutive_dry_days
* Accumulated total (liquid and/or solid) precipitation: https://xclim.readthedocs.io/en/stable/indices.html#xclim.indices.precip_accumulation 
			â†’ the latter should be the same as the 3 months accumulated precipitation: **it is** 

**Other useful utilities:** 

* Percentile value for each day of the year: https://xclim.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#xclim.core.calendar.percentile_doy
* Converts eastward and northward wind components to wind speed and direction: https://xclim.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#xclim.core.utils.uas_vas_2_sfcwind

**Ensemble sub-module:** 

{{{code: lang="python" linenumbers="True"
from xlim import ensembles
}}}


see:  https://xclim.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#module-xclim.ensembles 

of particular interest: 

https://xclim.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#xclim.ensembles.kmeans_reduce_ensemble

Return **a sample of ensemble members using k-means clustering**. The algorithm attempts to **reduce the total number of ensemble members while maintaining adequate coverage of the ensemble uncertainty in a N-dimensional data space**. K-Means clustering is carried out on the input selection criteria data-array in order to group individual ensemble members into a reduced number of similar groups. Subsequently a single representative simulation is retained from each group.

=== Derivation of regional (6 regions) time-series from the GCM outputs ===

see:

and the figures showing the regions (subsets) and ROI (shapes) for each GCM
