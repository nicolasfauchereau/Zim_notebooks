=== extraction of grids for super-resolution ML experiments ===

Extract the GCM grid points for the whole of NZ = melt the geometries, do this on a common HIGH RES GRID, not the interpolated grid of JMA, JMA will then be excluded from the analysis 

Note that depending on the model's resolution and grid, one might need to extend the margin to 2 degrees when selecting the subset with salem, e.g. with CanCM4i

{{{code: lang="python" linenumbers="True"
region = dset.salem.subset(shape=shape, margin=2)
}}}


The output (netcdf file) contains only grid points intersecting or inside the NZ multipolygon, and is exported for each GCM and Variable in 

[[/home/nicolasf/research/Smart_Ideas/outputs/targets/GCMs/NZ_shape_grid.]]

Note that ALL the ensemble members are kept, as it could be useful to augment the number of instance for super-resolution models ... 

Note that the time dimension is already shifted 3 months in the future so corresponds to the actual 'forecast valid time', with the usual convention that the month is the last month of the 3 months period (e.g. month 3 → March → January - March).
