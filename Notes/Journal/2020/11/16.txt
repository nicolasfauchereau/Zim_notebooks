==== calculation of the accuracy if applying the SCO forecasts to the Innovation Vineyards location ====

preliminary results for Innovation Vineyard in Blemheim

much better for than the SCO for rainfall, with the exception of May-June, the minimum accuracy using Machine Learning is pretty much consistently above the accuracy derived from the SCO

bit of a mixed bag for temperature, temperature by definition is much more spatially coherent than rainfall, hence the SCO forecasts for the NSI might be more representative of the location of the Innovation Vineyards near Blenhiem
