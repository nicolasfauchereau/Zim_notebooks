==== NeuralHydrology ====

https://github.com/neuralhydrology/neuralhydrology

 Python library to train neural networks with a strong focus on hydrological applications. 

--------------------

==== KTRAIN ====

ktrain is a Python library that makes deep learning and AI more accessible and easier to apply

source: https://github.com/amaiya/ktrain 

and cloned locally in 

[[/home/nicolasf/research/Smart_Ideas/resources/repos_libraries/ktrain]] 

see for tabular predictions: 

https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/amaiya/ktrain/blob/master/tutorials/tutorial-08-tabular_classification_and_regression.ipynb

experiments (Apple and Pears) using KTRAIN for classification and regression in 

[[/home/nicolasf/research/Smart_Ideas/code/models/application_cases/classification/Apple_and_Pears/KTRAIN/notebooks]] 

not great, but maybe regression could be pushed further 

--------------------

==== SRFLOW ====
