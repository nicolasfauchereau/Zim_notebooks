Pyleoclim 

see 

https://pyleoclim-util.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

especially 

https://pyleoclim-util.readthedocs.io/en/stable/utils/introduction.html

which includes several very useful functions, such as https://pyleoclim-util.readthedocs.io/en/stable/utils/correlation/corr_sig.html#utils-corr-sig which calculates the significance for non IID (i.e. serially correlated) time-series 

also have a look at: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/LinkedEarth/Pyleoclim_util/blob/master/example_notebooks/pyleoclim_ui_tutorial.ipynb 

which is totally SICK, includes causality analysis, wavelets and wavelet coherence analysis, etc 

"""
//The current version of Pyleoclim supports analysis such as spectral analysis, wavelet analysis, correlation analysis, coherence analysis, and causality analysis, etc.//
