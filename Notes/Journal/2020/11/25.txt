--------------------

==== MetSoc conference ====

some ideas 

→ we are using tree-based algorithns 

→ when and where (and why) predictability from obsevred SSTs > predictabiliuty for simulated (forecast) SSTs, alternative view compared to simple 'validation' of GCM forecasts against observations 


--------------------

==== chat with Neil Gordon at MetSoc ====


--------------------

==== climpred workshop ====

https://github.com/bradyrx/climpred_workshop 

should use for the comparison of the GCM forecasts to the observations 

--------------------

==== idea: train over overlapping seasons, bu evaluate / test over center season ====

e.g. train using all instances corresponding to NDJ, DJF, JFM, but only evaluate over DJF
