==== Apple and Pears, validation of the ENI forecasts agains the actual categories for the AP horticultural region: ====

see:

== rainfall ==

percentage of categories matching (ENI category == HB region category) 

69%

accuracy is using the forecasts for ENI rainfall

for rainfall, if I compare the forecast issued as part of the SCO with what actually happened in the AP horticultural region (a subsety of the whole ENI), the accuracy is 52% 

== temperature ==

percentage of categories matching (ENI category == HB region category) 

81%

for temperature, if I compare the forecast issued as part of the SCO with what actually happened in the AP horticultural region (a subsety of the whole ENI), the accuracy is 56% 
 
**over the past 3 years**, the accuracy is ~ 54% for rainfall but up to 85% for temperature 

== soil moisture ==

percentage of categories matching (ENI category == HB region category)

66% 

for soil moisture, if I compare the forecast issued as part of the SCO with what actually happened in the AP horticultural region (a subsety of the whole ENI), the accuracy is **~ 56% with tolerance and 48% without tolerance** 

**over the past 3 years**, the accuracy is ~ 60% with tolerance,

==== SOIL MOISTURE FORECASTs Apple and Pears ====

running [[https://autogluon.mxnet.io/|AUTOGLUON]] models, soil moisture categories 

so far preliminary results indicate ~ accuracy about **0.72** (!) for Soil Moisture, with simple random forest classifier, possibility that the resulting ensembles will exceed this accuracy. 

for quintile categories, the preliminary accuracy is ~ 55%, using an extra-tree classifier with Gini criteria (will probably go up)

possibly because the soil moisture results from the combination of rainfall (less predictable) and temperature (more predictable), but need to check first whether 
it is not down to some preprocessing issues
