@TODO 


- @SI write back apple and pears 
- @SI write back to all stakeholders ... confirm with Alan Grey first 

- @CPP CPP indices: 
	- SW Pacific regimes 
	- Kidson Types 
	â†’ asked whether it would be a better option to re-do the clustering using ERA5 
	

- @SI strategy for including observed fields and indices 
- @SI recode AUTOGLUON and PYCARET experiments to include if possible categorical predictor target season

- @HUB finish stocktake of CRIs and other institutions engage 

==== ICLR Workshop on Tackling Climate Change using Machine Learning ====

==== New release of Scikit Learn (0.23 release candidate) now includes Poisson regression (GLM with Poisson Loss) ====

see: 

https://scikit-learn.org/0.23/auto_examples/release_highlights/plot_release_highlights_0_23_0.html

will be useful for all attempts to forecast count data (e.g. number of days above given thresholds for example) 


==== Pandas trick: groupby month and count frequency of (e.g.) weather regime ====

example for the Kidson types, see [[/home/nicolasf/research/CPP/indices/notebooks/Kidson_types/composites_Kidson_types.ipynb]] 

//KT_ts.groupby([KT_ts.index.month, 'type']).size().unstack(fill_value=0).T//
