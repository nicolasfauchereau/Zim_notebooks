subseasonal forecasts: 120 hours 

Evaluate the accuracy of the probabilistic sub-seasonal forecasts made available through the Copernicus Data Store by calculating various metrics and skill scores (deterministic such as correlation and probabilistic such asÂ Continuous Ranked Probability Skill Score and Brier Score). 

Pacific RCC: 75 hours
