==== Climate Indices in Python ====

see: 

https://climate-indices.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ 

his project contains Python implementations of various climate index algorithms which provide a geographical and temporal picture of the severity of precipitation and temperature anomalies useful for climate monitoring and research.

The following indices are provided:

* **SPI**, Standardized Precipitation Index, utilizing both gamma and Pearson Type III distributions
* **SPEI**, Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index, utilizing both gamma and Pearson Type III distributions
* **PET**, Potential Evapotranspiration, utilizing either Thornthwaite or Hargreaves equations
* PDSI, Palmer Drought Severity Index
* scPDSI, Self-calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index
* PHDI, Palmer Hydrological Drought Index
* Z-Index, Palmer moisture anomaly index (Z-index)
* PMDI, Palmer Modified Drought Index
* PNP, Percentage of Normal Precipitation
