==== Python-related stuff ====

**Steve Wilcox**, regional manager Wellington, visit to Lauder, request for Alex Geddes re. Python resources 

**Jade Maggs**, Group Manager for NIWA Fisheries Data Services, request for Python training. 

==== T&I HUb ====

**Jenni  Gadd:** request to join the visualisation and delivery HUB, bring into project for developing an interactive dashboard for climate and environmental metrics for Aotearoa / NZ 

**Simon Woodward,** mathematical modeller and data scientist, up for a chat 9:30 July 9 

**Dana Briscoe**: include in interactive realtime dashboard, see below: 

==== Monitoring the vital signs of our environment ====

//These are some thoughts related to a potential Smart Ideas bid, around the development of a multivatiate, multi-sectorial, interactive dashnoard for climate, ocean and environmental metrics for Aotearoa / NZ// 

**Motivation**
--------------------

NZ's climate is variable, changing, has a great impact on activoties, economies, enviropnments

physical environment is also changing, subject to increased pressures, from climate change and human activities 

Sources of realtime / up to date information are scattered, also limited in scope, with metrics generally univariate, based on simple indices, 

//data science, network theories, systems approach// 

Equivalent of a hospital monitor, moniotoring the vital signs of our regional environment, identifying trends, potential conflicts, cascades, tipping points 

spatial statistics, 

e.g. 

→ proportion of specific **eco-regions** in drought, areas in drought, extremes, etc 
→ rainfall over land, freshwater fluxes over the ocean (E/P) using satellite remote sensing 
→ ocean heatwaves tracking around NZ 
→ primary productivity in the EEZ
→ air quality tracking across regional centres 
→ CO2 and other gases (Lauder) 
→ water quality

Maybe the concept of eco-regions / bio-regions need to be emphasized
