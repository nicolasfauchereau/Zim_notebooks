===== Compression of VCSN netcdf =====

see in **compress_netcdf.ipynb** in [[/home/nicolasf/operational/VCSN/notebooks]] 

added options to save netcdf variables in float32 instead of float64 and using zlib compression 

@Ideas 

== Normalizing each fold (in stratidied k-fold) by the multimodel / multiensemble Mu and Sigma. ==

The variability in the ensemble will ensure variance in the fields is conserved (i,e ensemble / GCM hot biased will presumably still be hot biased) 

== Other ideas ==

* Use the regional (6 regions) forecasts from the different GCMs as the features in structured classification or regression
* Use a mix of features derived from the GCMs and observational features (indices) as inputs 
* Use "Wide and Deep" architecture to mix 2D inputs (e.g. fed to CNNS) and 'structured' features (e.g. climate indices), see paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07792 

===== CNN: use the examples in WeatherBench ! =====

===== Also have a look at DEEPSD =====
