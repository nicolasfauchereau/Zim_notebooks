==== TODO ====

@TODO 

1. ~~review Shailesh's report ~~
2. ~~write Simon Woodward~~ 
3. Hubs: 
	a. ~~statistics channel in the analytics and modelling hub~~ 
	b. create a channel on each hub dedicated to ideas sharing, 'hounding' people who participated in the workshops to create a short post explaining their idea, hopefully this will generate discussions 
	c. change the 'Key Experts' tab to 'Team members' expertise', the 'key experts' will emerge naturally (hopefully) from this, maybe people do not feel comfortable being seen a considering themselves 'experts' ? also change it to e.g. excel spreadsheet, it is a wiki presently and it seems it does not allow for simultaneous editing, same goes for the ideas / suggestions table 

4. schedule follow up on T&I Hubs leadership meeting
