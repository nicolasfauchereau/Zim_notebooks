===== ClimAlign: Deep Generative Models for Climate Variables Downscaling =====

see: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_3VkgJk0zA&feature=youtu.be

code is available at: 

https://github.com/bgroenks96/generative-downscaling 

based on some early work done by the Meteorology Santander Group, with several related papers and implementations (in R !) at

MS Thesis is avaailable at https://search.proquest.com/openview/716b86a33eb0f7a609be1dfa7f0bae8b/1/advanced and copied locally

NOTE: cool trick in the code to replace values below threshold by random values from a given distribution 

prcp = xr.where(prcp < 1.0, np.random.uniform(0.0, 1.0, size=(prcp.Time.size, prcp.lat.size, prcp.lon.size)), prcp)

===== PYCLIMDEX =====

Implementation of **Climdex indices** in Python/xarray/dask  

see https://github.com/bgroenks96/pyclimdex 

pyclimdex currently supports the following indices for temperature and precipitation respectively:

**Temperature**

	Annual frost days
	Annual tropical nights
	Annual icing days
	Annual summer days
	Monthly max daily max temp (TXx)
	Monthly min daily max temp (TXn)
	Monthly max daily min temp (TNx)
	Monthly min daily min temp (TNx)
	Daily temperature range (DTR)

**Precipitation**

	Monthly 1-day precip (Rx1day)
	Monthly 5-day precip (Rx5day)
	Annual 10mm precip days
	Annual 20mm precip days
	Annual n mm precip days
	Total precipitation (variable time period)
	Simple intensity index (SDII)
	Consecutive dry days (CDD)
	Consecutive wet days (CWD)
