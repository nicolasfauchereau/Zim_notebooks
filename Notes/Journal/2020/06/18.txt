xclim.ensembles.kmeans_reduce_ensemble 

Return a sample of ensemble members using k-means clustering. The algorithm attempts to reduce the total number of ensemble members while maintaining adequate coverage of the ensemble uncertainty in a N-dimensional data space. K-Means clustering is carried out on the input selection criteria data-array in order to group individual ensemble members into a reduced number of similar groups. Subsequently a single representative simulation is retained from each group.
