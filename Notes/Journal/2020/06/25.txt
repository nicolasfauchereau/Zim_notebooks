===== Download the CDS for the ICU =====

see 

[[/home/nicolasf/operational/ICU/development/hotspots/notebooks/CDS/download_CDS_ICU.ipynb]] 


===== Worth experimenting with scikit-downscale for precipitation ICU ? =====

see 

https://github.com/jhamman/scikit-downscale 

in particular the BCSD (**BCSD, Bias correction and statistical disaggregation) **method, illustrated below 


{{~/operational/ICU/development/hotspots/The-major-procedures-of-the-BCSD-downscaling-method.png}}

**BCSD, Bias correction and statistical disaggregation** 

see in particular the amended examples in 

[[/home/nicolasf/operational/ICU/development/hotspots/downscale/scikit-downscale/examples]] 

and **2020ECAHM-scikit-downscale.ipynb** in particular, which compares different models for downscaling, including applying the BCSD precipitation model on every point on a grid 

see also (under development) 

will implement, through method **SpatialDownscaler**: 

== Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA) ==

http://www.climatologylab.org/maca.html 

Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA) is a statistical method for downscaling Global Climate Models (GCMs) from their native coarse resolution to a higher spatial resolution that captures reflects observed patterns of daily near-surface meteorology and simulated changes in GCMs experiments. This method has been shown to be slightly preferable to direct daily interpolated bias correction in regions of complex terrain due to its use of a historical library of observations and multivariate approach.
