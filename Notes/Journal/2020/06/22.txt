===== ICU Hotspot =====

Refactored the utility functions and the mapping functions in **utils.py** and **plot.py** respectively, see 

[[/home/nicolasf/operational/ICU/development/hotspots/code/hotspot]] 

notebook now imports and uses these functions, see 

[[/home/nicolasf/operational/ICU/development/hotspots/notebooks/GPM_IMERG/calculate_and_map_decile_bin.ipynb]] 

=== Processing steps ===

**1) download the latest data, extract domain, interpolate on the TRMM grid** 

see  get_daily_GPM_IMERG_netcdf.py in [[~/operational/ICU/ops/data/GPM_IMERG/daily/scripts]] 

call with 

./get_daily_GPM_IMERG_netcdf.py -o ../extended_SP -lonW 125 -lonE 240 -latN 25 -latS -50 -s 20200608 -e 20200622

2**) get the last N [30, 60, 90] days **

3) calculate and plots the deciles categories

The code is available at https://github.com/FREVA-CLINT/climatereconstructionAI  


It i Is an applictaion of this code 

https://github.com/naoto0804/pytorch-inpainting-with-partial-conv 

and more probably this one 

https://github.com/NVIDIA/partialconv 

by NVIDIA 

application of the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07723 

Image Inpainting for Irregular Holes Using Partial Convolutions

There's also a keras implementation here:

seems to be all based on the UNET architecture
