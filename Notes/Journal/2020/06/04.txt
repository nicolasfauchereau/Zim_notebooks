===== Smart Ideas =====

=== Validations: ===

[ ] revisit the notebooks and fix the errors preventing the use of xskillscore and climpred to derive the validation statistics 
[ ] find solution for the validation of very large datasets + the ensemble for each GCM 
[ ] derive a dictionnary mapping each variable to its units (once aggregated seasonally) and potential conversion parameters to allow direct comparison with the observational (ERA5) datasets 
[ ] for rainfall and temperature, derive a version of VCSN on the same grid as the GCMs (xesmf or xarray interp) 

=== Targets: ===

[*] recalculate a version of the target 6 regions time-series, using the (assumed) methodology used for the derivation of the 'probs.lst' time-series, i.e. in each region, each pixel is classified, then the majority class is the class for the region and for the season 

see notebook **calculates_6_regions_terciles_from_grid_cliops.ipynb** in [[/home/nicolasf/research/Smart_Ideas/code/targets/VCSN]] 

NOTE: need the development version of salem, see https://salem.readthedocs.io/en/v0.2.3/installing.html 

pip install git+https://github.com/fmaussion/salem.git 

probably because the format of the CRS in geopandas has recently changed 

[*] compare (calculate the percent matching) the 'cliops' definition to the previous definition 

for TMEAN, results (percent matching category) are: 

NNI    0.677551
ENI    0.693878
WNI    0.702041
NSI    0.736735
WSI    0.775510
ESI    0.963265

for RAIN, results (percent matching category) are

NNI    0.467347
ENI    0.418367
WNI    0.483673
NSI    0.508163
WSI    0.387755
ESI    0.881633

i.e. the match is much much worse 

[*] recalculate the scores (SCO) using both the regional averages (as done before) and the above for the SCO

These are not signifcantly different from the figures calculated using the first method (regional average THEN calculation of the tercile categories) 
	

=== Models ===

[ ] start on the regression experiments 
[ ] check that the csv files on deuce actually are the latest versions 



===== CPP Indices =====

[ ] go back to the Kidson Types, see in the MS Teams what actions need to be taken 

===== Island Climate Update 'hotspot' =====
