==== Analog forecasts for the SCO ====

Discussion with Ben on Teams, he uses velocity potential (at 200 hPa) to derive 'manual' analogs for the SCO forecasting, extracting analog to CDS forecasts in the ERA5 reanalysis data 

very easy to extract this automatically ... 

--------------------

==== ICU hotspots ====

some products to develop 

1) select grid points with observed percentile value below a given threshold (50 %) and indicate (using the forecast percentile) what is the **tendency for next month** (getting drier ? getting wetter ?) 
2) think about how to go about merging different accumulation periods 
3) map the most likely percentile value (mode? use np.digitize?)

==== Car booking ====

Ford Mondeo GQM 2016 from Friday evening to Thursday morning 

--------------------

==== Example of applying `xr.apply_ufunc` ====

def _mode(*args, **kwargs):
	import scipy
	vals = scipy.stats.mode(*args, **kwargs)
	# only return the mode (discard the count)
	return vals[0].squeeze()


def mode(obj, dim=None):
	# note: apply always moves core dimensions to the end
	# usually axis is simply -1 but scipy's mode function doesn't seem to like that
	# this means that this version will only work for DataArray's (not Datasets)
	import xarray as xr
	assert isinstance(obj, xr.DataArray)
	axis = obj.ndim - 1
	return xr.apply_ufunc(_mode, obj,
						  input_core_dims=dim,
						  kwargs={'axis': axis})
