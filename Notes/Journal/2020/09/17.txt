==== experiment with Pycaret and the ECMWF full period ====

experiments with the ECMWF t2m predictors over the 1981 - 2016 period (with 1981 - 2010 climatology for the calculation of the anomalies)  

see **pycaret_v2_wPCA_ECMWF_1981_2010.ipynb** 

==== replace percentage signs in pandas ====

df_GDP['GDP growth(real)'].replace({'%': ''}, regex=True).astype('float')

==== NOTE: remove KNNs from the models evaluated when trained using the "augmented" data sets ====

Instances are basically repeated (even though there are slight differences between the members) so this is not realistic 

==== APCC CLIKS ====
