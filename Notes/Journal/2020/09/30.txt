=== Apple and Pears ===

see in 

[[/home/nicolasf/research/Smart_Ideas/code/targets/application_cases/Apple_and_Pears/notebooks]] for the notebook (**read_shapefile.ipynb**) reading the shapefile, and getting the bounding box

The netcdf file with the bounding box (latmin, latmax, lonmin, lonmax) 

is [[/home/nicolasf/research/Smart_Ideas/data/shapefiles/application_cases/Apple_and_Pears/Apple_and_Pears_bounding_box.nc]] 

[[/home/nicolasf/research/Smart_Ideas/data/shapefiles/application_cases/Apple_and_Pears/Apple_and_Pears_bounding_box.nc]] 

use this for selection and extraction of VCSN data

=== Innovation Vineyard ===

see extraction notebook: **read_shapefile.ipynb** in  [[~/research/Smart_Ideas/code/targets/application_cases/Innovation_Vineyard/notebooks]] 

The netcdf file with the bounding box (latmin, latmax, lonmin, lonmax) 

is [[~/research/Smart_Ideas/data/shapefiles/application_cases/InnovationVineyards/Innovation_Vineyard_bounding_box.nc]] 

The notebook also extracts the DAILY raw data for all variables (['TMEAN_N', 'TMIN_N', 'TMAX_N', 'RAIN_BC', 'SOILM', 'RAD'])
