see from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11546858/python-multiprocessing-keyword-arguments 

I am trying to pass the same style keyword arguments to a multiprocessing task, but the use of **, in the args list is a syntax error. I know that my function, stretch() will take two positional arguments and n keyword arguments. 
pool = [multiprocessing.Process(target=stretch, args= (shared_arr,slice(i, i+step)),kwargs=args) for i in range (0, y, step)]
