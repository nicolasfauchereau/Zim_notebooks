--------------------

Check downloads, preprocessing and processing for the SI GCMs 

see

also use YAML files to store dictionnaries, e.g. notebook `make_yaml.ipynb`

==== GEFS version 12 data, for possible subseasonal (15 days to one month) downscaling ====

Note that GEFS version 12 is available on AWS, see 

https://registry.opendata.aws/tag/meteorological/

https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-gefs-reforecast/#usageexamples 

and in particular https://github.com/vgensini/gefs_v12_example/blob/master/GEFS_v12_eample.ipynb 
as well as https://mogismog.github.io/retro-diss-part-3.html#retro-diss-part-3 

and https://github.com/mogismog/redissertation/blob/master/redissertation/process_reforecast_data.py 

check in particular the parallel processing of the download: 

from joblib import Parallel, delayed


	# TODO: Should this be async and not parallelized?
	_ = Parallel(n_jobs=n_jobs, verbose=25)(
		delayed(download_and_process_grib)(
			f,
			latitude_bounds,
			longitude_bounds,
			forecast_days_bounds,
			local_save_dir,
			pressure_levels,
		)
		for f in globbed_list
	)


These are downloaded in [[/home/nicolasf/operational/GEFS/reforecast_on_AWS]] 

Note that some members apparently go out to 35 days 

https://noaa-gefs-retrospective.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html 

grid resolution is 0.25 deg. out to 10 days, 0.5 deg beyond 10 days 

suggested that we could use neural networks to do the downscaling, and if so you can 'pretrain' the NN models on e.g. the reanalyses (which are longer, i.e. a product such as ERA5). We could try getting some co-funding from T&I, as there's an aspect related to training the models to automatically extract informational, non-linear features from weather forecasts fields, this part is generalisable to other applications
