Talk title: Scalable Covariance Approximations for Environmental and Climate Data

Abstract: Dense covariance or kernel matrices arise frequently in geospatial analysis, machine learning, and simulation of systems governed by partial differential equations. Many standard algorithms involving such kernel matrices are computationally infeasible for large datasets. We consider a sparse approximation to the Cholesky factor of the inverse kernel matrix. The approximation can be written in closed form and computed in parallel, and it includes many popular existing approximations as special cases. We discuss extensions and applications to spatial modeling and prediction (i.e., kriging), analysis of computer experiments, statistical emulation of climate models, and data assimilation.

and 

https://github.com/jweyn/DLWP-CS 

which includes amazing tutorials ... 

the latter requires the library
