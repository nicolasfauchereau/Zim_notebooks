=== Meeting SI sector engagement ===

Chris, Andrew, Ben 

**context:** 

Contract extended to March 2021 

Busy with ML aspect, I have recently conducted more experiments with Convolutional Auto-encoders, and I think that work can be the base for a system where instead of forecasting regional categorical time-series, we can forecast seasonal rainfall or temperature anomalies directly at the VCSN grid (which has implications for the NZDI prediction project). I am Bringing Neelesh in as well as Raghav, who has worked with Convolutional Neural Networks, and we've got now a BsC at the Waikato Uni dept of computing and mathematical sciences who will work on one technique (CNNs with partial convolutions, as in the paper "AI reconstructs climate information) 

With my new position, leaves me no time really to deal with the **Sector Engagement,** and I am bad at it anyway ... 

A few things hanging from before lockdown: 

1) re-engage with HB regional council + Apple and Pears 
2) engagement with Bragato Institute + Innovation Vineyards 
3) engagement with Watercare 

rekindle the engagement with GWRC (Alex Pezza) 

The application cases results will be realistic available in a good shape ~ **end of October**, so planning workshops around end of November would be ideal, so that's something that we should I guess sort out as soon as possible

Maybe 

1 in Auckland with Watercare ? 
2 Wellington region 
3 HB with regional council and apple and pears 
5 Bragato research institute ?  

Survey re. use of seasonal climate forecasts, different scenarios (40, 50, 60 % accuracy, what does that mean for the farmers ? collaborate with Landcare (Ben Wiercinsky) 

**Chris 30 → 80 to 100 **
**Andrew 75 → 200 **
**Ben 40 → 80** 

=== Meeting Neelesh and Raghav (Deep Learning for Seasonal Climate forecasting) ===

Some ideas:

1. use ERA5 as the outputs instead of VCSN (for testing the approach)
2. create repository for all the DL code: done at https://github.com/nicolasfauchereau/DL4SEAS 
3. create a MS Teams ? 
4. Wide and Deep architectures, see https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2/blob/master/10_neural_nets_with_keras.ipynb for example, see https://github.com/nicolasfauchereau/DL4SEAS/blob/master/wide_and_deep/notebooks/wide_and_deep_example.ipynb 


=== Meeting with Campbell ===

Around the development of a newsletter 

1) Email Newsletter (Outlook theming ?), apparently the CAH 'Memo' email is quite a success 

2) mix bottom up (what's been happening on the hubs, what has been shared, what projects and ideas have been discussed) and 'top down' views from the T&I hubs science advisory group, reflecting on the activities and current trends in their respective platforms / disciplines. 

1) have **Warrick Johnston** say a few words in every newsletter, give the sense to people that there is a direction / that this is led from the top, give the newsletter a voice 

2) include examples of how people use these technologies around NIWA 
	i) code from Kameron around using ML to classify weather from images 
	ii) my example, using auto-encoders to learn latent representation of large-scale climate fields 

3) Advertise the Data Science Journal Club, promote the adoption of this model (journal club across the other hubs) 

4) Data Science Journal club, have external people / invited speakers talk during the journal clubs 

5) Campbell is currently developping a communication plan for T&I, with specific deliverables, follow up on this when it's ready
