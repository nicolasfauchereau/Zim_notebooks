==== MHWs detection ====

On xarray datasets / time-series of masked data 

see **OISST_realtime_NZ_detect_MHWs.ipynb**  in [[/home/nicolasf/operational/OISST_indices/notebooks]] 

1) use interpolate_na with `max_gap` parameter to get rid of the gaps in the data

2) fill_na (with 0) 

3) ndimage.label

@downscaling 


1) we had a meeting with Raghav a couple of weeks ago about the augmented VCSN (rainfall). In order to contextualise the evaluation of the model's simulations (CCAM + ML and stats downscaling) against this product, we thought it would be good to have a dataset that gives for each VCSN pixel, the density of in-situ observations that went into the interpolation procedure, I have grabbed the relevant files from cliops, and started working on this, will generate maps and relevant netcdf / zarr files, which I will put on the HPC 

→ see in 

 

2) For the statistical downscaling and bias correction (BCSD), I did a bit of literature review and digging around, I think that besides Abha's method, we could choose to apply a set of methods, which are documented and for which there are already open-source software implementations which we could leverage. To start the discussion, these are the ones we could focus on: 
 
a) The BCSD methods based on Empirical Quantile Mapping and derivatives, as implemented in https://xclim.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sdba.html#sdba-user-api. Each of these are based on published methods 
 
b) Generalized Analog Regression Downscaling (GARD) as in:  
 
Clark, M. P., & Hay, L. E. (2004). Use of medium-range numerical weather prediction model output to produce forecasts of streamflow. Journal of Hydrometeorology, 5(1), 15–32. doi:10.1175/1525-7541(2004)005<0015:UOMNWP>2.0.CO;2

Clark, M. P., & Slater, A. G. (2006). Probabilistic quantitative precipitation estimation in complex terrain. Journal of Hydrometeorology, 7(1), 3–22. doi:10.1175/JHM474.1
 
c) Multivariate Adapted Constructed Analogs (MACA) as in 
 
Abatzoglou, J.T., Brown, T.J., 2012. A comparison of statistical downscaling methods suited for wildfire applications: STATISTICAL DOWNSCALING FOR WILDFIRE APPLICATIONS. Int. J. Climatol. 32, 772–780. https://doi.org/10.1002/joc.2312
 
d) DeepSD (which is a Deep Learning approach, so not strictly speaking 'statistical' downscaling) as in 

Vandal, T., Kodra, E., Ganguly, S., Michaelis, A., Nemani, R., Ganguly, A.R., 2017. DeepSD: Generating High Resolution Climate Change Projections through Single Image Super-Resolution 4. https://doi.org/10.1145/3097983.3098004
 
The latter 3 have been used for the generation of a new global downscaled (1/4 degree, ERA5 precip, tasmin and tasmax as target variables) product available on Azure, created by CarbonPlan (see  https://docs.carbonplan.org/cmip6-downscaling). I have started looking at the historical downscaled products and my plan is to evaluate against a coarsened version of VCSN. These are downscaled straight from the CMIP6 simulations, but it might be valuable however to gauge what biases remain for what method. 
 
3) have started to compile a document listing ideas for a set of consistent model evaluation approaches (variables, statistics, and metrics) which I will share next week. These are suggestions only, following the discussion we had related to the need for some kind of consistent, reproducible evaluation strategy. 
 
cheers
