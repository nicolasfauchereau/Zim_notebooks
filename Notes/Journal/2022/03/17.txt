==== [S2S Webinar Series] S2S AI Challenge (26 Jan. 14:00 UTC) ====

Title: **Submissions to the s2s-ai-challenge beating climatology**

Speaker: **Top 5 submissions teams**

Date & Time: Wednesday, January 26, 2022, 14:00pm UTC 

Abstract 

The five submissions beating week 3-4 / week 5-6 2-metre temperature and total precipitation climatology will present their approaches in 10’ talks each. Afterwards, there will be 8’ Q&A each and a final 10’ discussion, so the event will last 2h.

Speakers

- Damien Specq; CNRM/Meteo-France

- Nina Horat, Sebastian Lerch, Julian Quinting, Daniel Steinfeld, Pavel Zwerschke; KIT-ETH-UBern

- Shanglin Zhou, Adam Bienkowski; UConn

- Sergi Bech, Llorenç Lledó, Lluís Palma, Carlos Gomez, Andrea Manrique; BSC

- Bertrand Denis, David Landry, Jordan Gierschendorf, Arlan Dirkson; CRIM

==== MAELSTROM dissemination workshop (28 March) and Machine Learning Workshop (29 March - 1 April) ====

==== Jawls ====

Common facial exercises that may help improve jowls include:

→ Yawning and opening the mouth as far as possible, then closing it very slowly without letting the teeth touch.
→ Puckering the lips outwards. This exercise works best when done lying down, and by using the fingers to draw the sides of the mouth downwards.
→ Blowing the cheeks up as far as comfortable.
→ Chewing with the head tilted slightly up.
→ Grinning as widely as comfortable then slowly tilting the head up and down.
→ Putting the lower lip on the top lip and tilting the head up.
→ Lying down flat, curling the neck in towards the chest with the tongue pressing on the roof of the mouth.
→ Humming with the tongue pressed against the roof of the mouth.
→ Saying the sounds “o” followed by “e,” using more force than usual and exaggerating mouth movements.
