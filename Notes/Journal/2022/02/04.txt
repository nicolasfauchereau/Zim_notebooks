==== Forecasting with sktime: Designing sktime's New Forecasting API and Applying It to Replicate and Extend the M4 Study ====

https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08067

We present a new open-source framework for forecasting in Python. Our framework forms part of sktime, a more general machine learning toolbox for time series with scikit-learn compatible interfaces for different learning tasks. Our new framework provides dedicated forecasting algorithms and tools to build, tune and evaluate composite models. We use sktime to both replicate and extend key results from the M4 forecasting study. In particular, we further investigate the potential of simple off-the-shelf machine learning approaches for univariate forecasting. Our main results are that simple hybrid approaches can boost the performance of statistical models, and that simple pure approaches can achieve competitive performance on the hourly data set, outperforming the statistical algorithms and coming close to the M4 winner.

@ClimateCommons 

Idea: get the email addresses of every MP etc and send then an email with the headlines from the most dire papers out there: 

- coral reefs doomed 
- etc etc
