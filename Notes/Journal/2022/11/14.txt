==== EOFs / XCLIM ====

TIL (today I learned) that EOFs https://ajdawson.github.io/eofs/latest/index.html is a cheeky toolbox 
 
If you don't tell it to not be greedy, it will take all the cores of the machine it is running on, not great if you are running on a shared machine with other users... how to prevent this?
 
If you are running a script from the command line, export some environment variables to limit numpy multithreading (here to 1 thread)


export MKL_NUM_THREADS=1
export NUMEXPR_NUM_THREADS=1
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1

(you don't need all these variables, it depends how your numpy has been compiled, e.g. with or without MKL, but... in doubt it's easier to just set all of them )
 
and if you are running in a notebook, set these variables in your first cell, before any python import using

%env MKL_NUM_THREADS=1
%env NUMEXPR_NUM_THREADS=1
%env OMP_NUM_THREADS=1

 
I hope this can help.
