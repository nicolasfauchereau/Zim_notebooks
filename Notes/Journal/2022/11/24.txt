Notes: 

We have deliberately chosen not to try and correct the simulated ice loss trend to that which PIOMAS depicts 

different methods tested: 

**Additive correction**: 

Corrects the time mean by subtracting the difference between the historical model ensemble-mean time mean, 〈Mh〉, and observation time mean, Oh, from each of the model ensemble members, M.

**Multiplicative correction:** 

the ratio of the observed time mean and model ensemble-mean time mean, Oh/〈Mh〉, is multiplied as a factor to the model ensemble members, M, then the corrected thickness is as follows.

**Mean multiplicative correction: **

**Mean and variance correction**

To incorporate the variance correction, the mean multiplicative correction (Eq. 3) is first de-trended, the variance correction applied, and the trend re-applied. This creates the Mean And VaRIance Correction (MAVRIC), shown in Eq. (4).
