==== SST validation paper ====

→ Powerpoint in 2 weeks
→ paper in draft form ~ January 2023

rough structure: 

	- deterministic 
	- probabilistic (focus on MHWs ?)

==== problem with regionmask: ====

**AttributeError: module 'regionmask' has no attribute 'from_geopandas'**

probably need to upgrade to development version, as the version installed is 0.5.0 but the latest version is 0.9 

see https://regionmask.readthedocs.io/en/stable/whats_new.html#breaking-changes

and  https://regionmask.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html 

pip install git+https://github.com/regionmask/regionmask
