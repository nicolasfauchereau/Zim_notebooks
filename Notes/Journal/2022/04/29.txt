Hi Nico

Just to include some documents which are likely relevant unpacking (or deriving relationships for tools ingestion etc) re water availability differences in the Pacific (groundwater vs water tank, etc) and how meteorological drought translate into water security issues.

Let me know if any of these are useful for deriving the info you need for your paper and what info gaps are still looming – as we can then follow-up with our SPC and other regional colleagues to help plug some of the info gaps.

Cheers, Shaun

==== avoiding disk quotas issues with large conda environments ====

@python @conda @mamba 

see email from Wolfgang Hayek: 

"""
Hi David,

I would recommend going with either Tristan’s solution of symlinking .conda, or pointing conda to a different directory for its package cache by adding the following config to “~/.condarc”,

pkgs_dirs:

  - /some/path/conda/pkgs

and creating conda environments outside the home directory. Both ways will avoid filling up your home directory.

Cheers,

Wolfgang
