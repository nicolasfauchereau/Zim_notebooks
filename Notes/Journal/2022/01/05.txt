==== ICU (operational) figures ====

rename the EAR Watch plots: 

Suggestion to address – how does this sound:

Title: Change to “Regional Situation Summary (30 November 2021)” – and carry this through to the SPI and USDM pages

First line:  “Alert levels (aligned with the Early Action Rainfall thresholds) for cumulative rainfall over the last 90 and 30 days are shown in the plots below”  (swap in SPI/USDM on those pages)

In the figures we change legend title of the three plots to:

**→ Water Stress (90 days to 30 Nov 2021)**

**(aligned to “EAR” Alert levels)**

→ Water Stress (90 days to 30 Nov 2021)

(aligned to “SPI” Alert levels)

→ Water Stress (90 days to 30 Nov 2021)

(aligned to “USDM” Alert levels)

solution is to test whether the maximum longitude is below 0, if yes, we reproject using 0 as the Prime Meridian, if not, we use geo.shift_geom
