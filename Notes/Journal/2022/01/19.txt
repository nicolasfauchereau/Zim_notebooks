@ICU 

**TODO:** separate the folders holding the climatologies and ancillary files derived from the code in [[~/operational/ICU/development/hotspots/code/ICU_Water_Watch/notebooks/ICU_forecast_table,]] which is based on the **operational** hindcast dataset (which are not complete for some of the GCMs) and the climatologies and ancillary files calculated from the code in [[/home/nicolasf/operational/ICU/development/hotspots/code/ICU_Water_Watch/notebooks/ICU_forecast_table_validation,]] which is based on the complete hindcasts, which do not necessarily correspond to the latest system versions of the different GCMs.
