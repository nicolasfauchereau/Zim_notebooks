==== OISST realtime MHWs tracking and NZ indices ====

implemented timeout decorator on the access to OISST v2 via OpenDAP, now reverts to requests / io if opendap fails to save to disk within 120 seconds 

see [[/home/nicolasf/operational/OISST_indices/code]] 


def timeout(timeout_secs: int):
	import time
	import signal
	from functools import wraps

	def wrapper(func):
		@wraps(func)
		def time_limited(*args, **kwargs):
			# Register an handler for the timeout
			def handler(signum, frame):
				raise Exception(f"Timeout for function '{func.__name__}'")

			# Register the signal function handler
			signal.signal(signal.SIGALRM, handler)

			# Define a timeout for your function
			signal.alarm(timeout_secs)

			result = None
			try:
				result = func(*args, **kwargs)
			except Exception as exc:
				raise exc
			finally:
				# disable the signal alarm
				signal.alarm(0)

			return result

		return time_limited

	return wrapper

→ defines the decorator 

@timeout(120)
def download_dap(
	url=None,
	domain=[162.0, 180.0, -50.0, -30.0],
	opath=None,
):

→ wraps it around the download_dap function

==== Drew's MBIE endeavour on precision horticulture ====

== background and motivation ==

the general background only, I am getting to the CSs now but I wanted to check with you whether you think I am on the right track or not, what follows is bullet point style, just the base ideas, note that it might be too 'blue sky' yet for an Endeavour, although I will try to connect this to specific products / tools:

While weather forecasts are an initial conditions problem, for subseasonal (10 - 30 days) and more so seasonal (1 - 6 months) timescale, we have a mix of initial conditions and boundary conditions, with the latter becoming more important as time-scale increase

in the extratropics, the atmosphere is only partly constrained by boundary conditions, resulting in the stochastic (unpredictable) component playing a much larger role, it is especially the case for precip, which is governed by both macro-scale dynamical processes in the atmosphere and complex (and poorly understood) micro-physical processes

From a forecasting perspective, we can think about variability at subseasonal and seasonal time-scales as being constituted by both a predictable and an unpredictable component, with relative proportions varying in space and time, as well as being dependent on the spatial and timescales considered ... for example some spatial configurations (clusters ?) of rainfall and temperature of monthly or seasonally aggregated anomalies might be more predictable than others, some phenomena (dry spells, extreme rainfall, specific sequences of events) might be more predictable than others, and predictability is / may vary seasonally, as well as a function of the state of large-scale climate modes such as the MJO, ENSO, the SAM, etc ... \

For this project, the challenge is therefore to identify these predictable components, develop methodologies that enable to characterise how these predictable components transfer to the scales of interest  (i.e. orchard, vineyards) and develop innovative tools that leverage these 'windows of opportunity' to derive skillful, actionable forecasts, including uncertainties and confidence estimates.

In order to do so, this component of the programme will leverage large datasets, explainable AI methods for the identification of the predictable components and windows of opportunities, and innovative approaches in hybrid dynamical / statistical forecasting (adaptative bias correction). 

This constitutes a departure from how improvements of climate forecasts are usually approached and communicated, which usually fails to identify - and focus on -   the predictable components,  and pays little attention to contextualise the confidence in the forecasts in light of the apportion between predictable and unpredictable components.

note that there still will be a component akin to "spatio-temporal scaling of weather and climate prediction for vineyards and orchards" 

[14:12] Nicolas Fauchereau
but we focus on the predictable components at subseasonal and seasonal time-scale ... i.e. we develop 'tranfer functions' allowing to map the predictable components of climate variability over NZ to the variables of interest at orchard / vineyard scale 

[14:13] Nicolas Fauchereau
I truly think that climate over NZ is overall not very predictable, if we ignore this we are very likely to end up with poorly performing forecasts overall
