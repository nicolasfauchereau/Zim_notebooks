Treatment of the distributional tails has been a longstanding challenge in statistical downscaling of global climate models. Many widely used existing downscaled climate datasets available at a daily, global resolution used quantile mapping techniques that were known to dampen or amplify trends in the tails, which precludes capturing tail risks that are essential for modeling future climate impacts. In this study, we apply the trend-preserving Quantile Delta Mapping (QDM) bias adjustment method and develop a new downscaling algorithm called the Quantile Preserving Localized Analog Downscaling (QPLAD) method that also preserves trends in the tails of the distribution. QPLAD is a statistical downscaling algorithm that applies a local analog mapping approach to preserve quantile trends at the fine resolution of the reference dataset;“localized” refers to the 16 ¼-degree gridcells contained within a single 1° gridcell (the resolution at which we apply bias correction). We developed a novel software pipeline that integrates the QDM-QPLAD bias adjustment and downscaling methods and is fully open-source and reproducible and run entirely in Google Cloud in containerized applications. We apply the QDM-QPLAD method to global, daily model output for surface variables (maximum and minimum temperature and total daily precipitation) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) experiments for the historical experiment and four emissions scenarios: SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5. For daily precipitation, we also apply a wet day frequency correction before bias adjustment and after downscaling. We use hourly, global data from the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA5 reanalysis as our reference dataset over a training period consistent with the AR6 reference period, 1995-2014. This downscaled CMIP6 dataset, titled Global Downscaled Projections for Climate Impacts Research (GDPCIR), is now publicly available via the Microsoft Planetary Computer at a global, daily ¼-degree resolution for four emissions pathways and 25 CMIP6 models. The preservation of trends in quantiles that characterizes the dataset makes it well suited for modeling climate impacts as well as for extreme events such as wildfires.
