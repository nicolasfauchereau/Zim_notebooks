==== French Pacific Fund ====

@ICU 

call for proposal, deadline 11 November

==== calculation of surface parameters from elevation (slope, curvature, and aspect ) using xarray-spatial ====

@MBIE @CMIP6 

see https://pccompute.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com/compute/user/nicolas.fauchereau@niwa.co.nz/lab/tree/PlanetaryComputerExamples/tutorials/surface_analysis.ipynb 

also downloaded in [[/home/nicolasf/Jupyter_notebooks/]]**surface_analysis_xarray-spatial_Planetary_Computer.ipynb**

with example around Hamilton, NZ

could use NASA-DEM to calculate the average and std quantities for each VCSN grid point, and feed that to a model including wind and spec etc

===== Installation of pycaret =====

@ED 

installed in environment 'ED' 

trick is just to create a barebone conda env (with mamba, and just Python=3.9) and install EVERYTHING using pip (not conda / mamba), including xarray etc

**BUT** cannot install fbprophet !
