→ GEFS (out to 35 days) 
→ MSWX: global 3-hourly 0.1° bias-corrected meteorological data including near real-time updates and forecast ensembles

save netcdf files with the recoded time series, e.g. 

**recoded_sequences_Tmin_n_detrended_False_95_percentile_sequ_1.n**c 

for sequences of daily T_min over the 95th percentile (no detrend applied) 

- **l_starts_sequences_Tmin_n_detrended_False_95_percentile_sequ_1.npy**: for each grid point (11491 'agents') the indices of the starts of the sequences (a sequence here is being defined as at least 1 day) 
- **l_ends_sequences_Tmin_n_detrended_False_95_percentile_sequ_1.npy**: for each grid point (11491 'agents') the indices of the ends of the sequences (a sequence here is being defined as at least 1 day) 
- **l_durations_sequences_Tmin_n_detrended_False_95_percentile_sequ_1.npy:** for each grid point (11491 'agents') the duration of each sequence (a sequence here is being defined as at least 1 day)
