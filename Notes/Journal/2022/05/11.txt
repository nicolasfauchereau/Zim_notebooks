See various functions and methods in xclim, exemples of functions of interest: 

→ https://xclim.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#xclim.core.calendar.percentile_doy 

Percentile value for each day of the year.

Return the climatological percentile over a moving window around each day of the year. Different quantile estimators can be used by specifying alpha and beta according to specifications given by [HyndmanFan]. The default definition corresponds to method 8, which meets multiple desirable statistical properties for sample quantiles. Note that numpy.percentile corresponds to method 7, with alpha and beta set to 1.

→ https://xclim.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#xclim.core.calendar.resample_doy 

Create a temporal DataArray where each day takes the value defined by the day-of-year. 

i.e. to 'repeat' an xarray with DOY dimension onto the time dimension of another array (for comparisons) 

→ https://xclim.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#xclim.core.calendar.select_time 

Select entries according to a time period.

This conveniently improves xarray’s xarray.DataArray.where() and xarray.DataArray.sel() with fancier ways of indexing over time elements. In addition to the data da and argument drop, only one of season, month, doy_bounds or date_bounds may be passed.
