@TODO before the end of the FY 

**1) Identify a set of compound extreme weather events that could be characterized and modelled in both observations and regional climate simulations** 

Utilising the framework and typology developed by [2], we will first establish a list of compound extreme weather events suitable for analysis in both observational and climate change regional simulation datasets available at NIWA.  

Output: Summary report on the datasets and identified set of compound extreme weather events. 

compound in time ? i.e. sequences of events such as heatwaves defined as sequences of N days or more with tmean above the climatological 90th percentile 

**2) Analyse the properties of these compound extreme weather events in the observational dataset(s).**  

Based on observational datasets such as the Virtual Climate Station Network (VCSN) and / or  station data, we will identify, extract and derive the characteristics (seasonality, variability, **connections to circulation regimes**) of the compound extreme weather events identified above. These analyses will establish a baseline climatology and ground truth for the development of statistical models (based e.g. on dynamic Bayesian networks) able to model and simulate these types of multivariate events.  

Output: Summary report on the properties of selected compound extreme weather events in the observational datasets

re. the connection to weather regimes: 

//I did some work on circulation regimes (daily recurrent circulation patterns) and worked on some network representation of the transition probabilities between the regimes (i.e each circulation regime is a node, and the edges are proportional to the transition probabilities) could that be tied in any way to bayesian networks ? each type of compound extremes can possibly related to these circulation regimes//
