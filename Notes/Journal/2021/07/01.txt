==== hierarch: Resampling-Based Hypothesis Testing for Python ====

@stats @statistics 

https://github.com/rishi-kulkarni/hierarch

**hierarch** is a package for hierarchical resampling (bootstrapping, permutation) of datasets in Python. Because for loops are ultimately intrinsic to cluster-aware resampling, hierarch uses Numba to accelerate many of its key functions.

hierarch has several functions to assist in performing resampling-based (and therefore distribution-free) hypothesis tests, confidence interval calculations, and power analyses on hierarchical data.

Welch's t-test, or unequal variances t-test, is a two-sample location test which is used to test the hypothesis that two populations have equal means

Given that Welch's t-test has been less popular than Student's t-test[2] and may be less familiar to readers, a more informative name is "Welch's unequal variances t-test" â€” or "unequal variances t-test" for brevity

==== climate change council ====

Climate change is an infrastructure problem, which is a very, very hard thing to solve with software.

I realised that climate change is in essence an **infrastructure problem** 

climate intelligence will play a role, potentially an important role, to inform action, but ultimately action is implemented through changes in infrastructure, and that's where I want to be
