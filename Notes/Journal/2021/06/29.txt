Title: Statistical Climate Downscaling Using Machine Learning Approaches

The project investigated deep learning techniques for seasonal downscaling of GCM forecasts using convolutional neural networks. Dong implemented very high-dimensional multi-target regression and classification, a cutting-edge technique called tensor regression, special-purpose loss functions, and image inpainting techniques for this project.
