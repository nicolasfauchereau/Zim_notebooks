Group Meeting 

We finalised step 1 of the analyses for ZESPRI, and we just a workshop yesterday (Thursday) presenting the results to a group at ZESPRi including Dave Scullin (CIO), feedbacks are pretty positive at this point, with indications they would like to develop a commercial product. 

Continued analyses on the Wellington Hospital daily admission (project): used cluster analysis to determine a cluster of symptoms which present a significant seasonal component, then modelled the daily variations using a Generalized Additive Model, accounting for different periodicities (weekly, seasonal), trends, and the effects of holidays, thten incorporated daily weather as extra-regressor, correlation model / obs over 2019 (test period) is about 0.57. Am catching up on Monday with Kameron Christopher and Stephen Fitzherbert for a brainstorm. 

Finalised an array of analyses for project CDFP21 on circulation regimes and surface weather in New Zealand, see results compiled at

Had video conference a couple of weeks ago with several people at NOAA and at the US National Weather Service, where I presented the methodology I developed to derive a Pacific 'drought watch' combining realtime satellite rainfall monitoring (GPM-IMERG) and the monthly and seasonal forecasts from the C3S Multi-model (ECMWF, UKMO, Meteo-France, DWD, CMCC, NCEP, JMA, ECCC), very well received: Richard Heim (NOAA) is very interested in working with us to the Global Drought Forecasting component of the Global Drought Information System (GDIS, see https://gdis-noaa.hub.arcgis.com/), will firm up plan mid-july
