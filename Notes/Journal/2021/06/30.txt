===== climtas: Climate Timeseries Analysis =====


Climtas is a package for working with large climate analyses. It focuses on the time domain with custom functions for Xarray and Dask data.

Climtas includes a number of parallelised building blocks for **heatwave detection**

also: **Using xesmf to efficiently regrid data to another resolutionÂ¶**

	SPI, Standardized Precipitation Index, utilizing both gamma and Pearson Type III distributions
	SPEI, Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index, utilizing both gamma and Pearson Type III distributions
	PET, Potential Evapotranspiration, utilizing either Thornthwaite or Hargreaves equations
	PDSI, Palmer Drought Severity Index
	scPDSI, Self-calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index
	PHDI, Palmer Hydrological Drought Index
	Z-Index, Palmer moisture anomaly index (Z-index)
	PMDI, Palmer Modified Drought Index
	PNP, Percentage of Normal Precipitationa
