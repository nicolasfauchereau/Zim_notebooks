==== PYCARET experiments with Temperature ====

For temperature 

NNI, test period, extra-tree classifier obtains **0.81** accuracy on test set using forecast SSTs 3 months ahead 

predictability is defined as the accuracy of an set of ML al

experiments comparing the predictability of regional rainfall and temperature derived from regional scale forecast or observed SST tend to show greater predictability from forecast (i.e. GCM) than observed (past) SSTs. 

In all experiments, the leader board favors ensemble methods, such as catboost, xgboost, lightgbm and extratrees (extremely randomized trees) ,

also included is a categorical variable corresponding to the last month of the forecast period
