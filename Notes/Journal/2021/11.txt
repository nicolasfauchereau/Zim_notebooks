Thanks mate.  Itâ€™s been a pleasure working with you, youâ€™re definitely one of the good guys ðŸ˜Š

 I will keep in touch, sounds like weâ€™re on the same page when it comes to whatâ€™s important in this life.  Iâ€™m keen to hear how your mushroom growing works out too.

==== ENSO and titi ====

mail from Neelesh 

Hi Nico,

Hope all is well on your end and you are looking forward to a nice holiday!

Through Amy Whitehead, Ben and myself have been involved in some relationships between ENSO and titi bird populations (and other statistics). Iâ€™ve brought this up in a previous conversation I had with you Nico, but I was checking if were still interested in being involved? I feel like this is the type of analysis you do in your sleep ðŸ˜Š.

Anyways, Iâ€™ve attached some reading content if you are interested. But we expect further discussions to continue next financial year. The project has been successfully funded as part of a Smart Ideas lead by Land Care, and weâ€™d likely start work either towards the end of the FY, or would start next FY.

Off the top of my head, I think they have about 1/3rd FTE of funding (per year I think but no sure) for this aspect of the project and I can confirm other details in future meetings.

The main idea of the project (at least my understanding at the moment), is that we are establishing relationships between titi population characteristics (e.g. adult survival rate, chick size and perhaps migratory patterns) as a function of climate and oceanographic variables, with the key focus being establishing the physical mechanisms for variability in these characteristics. There are some interesting results, such as distinct population changes (I think in the adult survival rate) prior to ENSO events.

I think youâ€™ve done a lot of cool stuff that is similar to what they want to do for this project, and I think youâ€™d have some really cool inputs for further discussion, so I hope you are keen ðŸ˜Š . In the next year, Iâ€™ll bring this up again and invite you to further discussion where we can discuss further.

Let me know your thoughts!

Merry Christmas and a happy new year!

Cheers,

Neelesh.
