==== Response of the biosphere to Climate Change ====





But: Climate change and primary production: Forty years in a bunchgrass prairie (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0243496): "Therefore, seasonal climate changes at a smaller geographical scale (local), rather than average annual climate changes over a larger geographical scale (regional), may better reflect plant community responses, and this makes ecological forecasting of climate change more difficult."
