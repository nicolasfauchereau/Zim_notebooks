==== Interest Group: the environment and human behavior ====

@behavior @behaviour @Gustavo

A couple of years ago Gustavo submitted a MBIE smart ideas concept note, generally speaking aimed at investigating the link the impacts of environmental conditions (air quality, weather and climate conditions) on human behavior (+ moods, attitudes) 

The main idea was to exploit the wealth of data available on various aspect of human behavioral patterns, moods and attitudes, such as: 

- live and historical traffic data (including active modes of transport: cycling, walking, micro-mobility platforms, etc)
- hospital admissions, other potential health indicators
- crime reports (?) 
- other sources of data on people's movements such as from GPS-enabled phone apps, the latter including potentially fitbit or equivalent data, which includes the type of activity people are engaged in ...
- patronage for public spaces and when available private spaces (shops, malls, etc)
- spending patterns from publicly available data and obtained through potential partnerships with retail operators, banks. 
- etc 

As well as data mined from social media platforms (sentiment analysis, etc) which could potential uncovers patterns of variability in moods and attitudes 

One motivation notably behind this research agenda is to see whether we can obtain and leverage data that has been used historically by 'big tech' companies for the purpose of targetted advertising - which essentially is a form of behavior manipulation - but for the common good, to uncover how the state of the environment (again, focusing on air quality, weather and climate ....) affects human behaviors, moods, attitudes, with the goal of using this information to promote human health (including mental health), alleviate potential risks, and encourage more sustainable behaviors ... 

Obviously a very important component of the research project should to be devoted to its ethical implications: including designing an infrastructure (material, software, processes and practices) that ensures fair, equitable and privacy-preserving use of the data, and avoids encoding of bias and inequalities in the research outcomes, it is likely we would need to develop partnerships with researchers and institutions that are focused on these problems (e.g. the Center for AI and Public Policy here in NZ, the AI for good initiative https://ai4good.org/about-us/ ? etc) 

We had a good discussion with Gus about this last week, first about fleshing out and resubmitting this proposal for a Smart Idea, but also about the possibility of establishing some kind of multidisciplinary "interest group" at NIWA on topics exploring the intersection between environmental data and behavioral data ... beyond us 2 (!) we think there could be more people interested, from the environmental to (computational) social scientists ... 


**NOTES:** 

this topic straddles different scales: 

weather impacts our day to day decision 

climate has been instrumental in the rise and fall of civilisations 

climate has been instrumental in ultimately influencing human evolution 

straddle different time-scales, and goes from the individual to the collective to the species level ...

==== Experimental evidence for scale-induced category convergence across populations ====


https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20037-y

**Abstract**: Individuals vary widely in how they categorize novel and ambiguous phenomena. This individual variation has led influential theories in cognitive and social science to suggest that communication in large social groups introduces path dependence in category formation, which is expected to lead separate populations toward divergent cultural trajectories. Yet, anthropological data indicates that large, independent societies consistently arrive at highly similar category systems across a range of topics. How is it possible for diverse populations, consisting of individuals with significant variation in how they categorize the world, to independently construct similar category systems? Here, we investigate this puzzle experimentally by creating an online “Grouping Game” in which we observe how people in small and large populations collaboratively construct category systems for a continuum of ambiguous stimuli. We find that solitary individuals and small groups produce highly divergent category systems; however, across independent trials with unique participants, large populations consistently converge on highly similar category systems. A formal model of critical mass dynamics in social networks accurately predicts this process of scale-induced category convergence. Our findings show how large communication networks can filter lexical diversity among individuals to produce replicable society-level patterns, yielding unexpected implications for cultural evolution.
