==== ML Hyperparameters fitting with DASK ====

https://github.com/nesi/hpc_for_datascience_demos/tree/master/notebooks 

try and apply https://github.com/nesi/hpc_for_datascience_demos/blob/master/notebooks/hyperparameters_search_nzrse.ipynb 

with **skorch (pytorch)** applied to GCM data vs VCSN output 

see: [[~/research/Smart_Ideas/resources/repos_application_cases/hpc_for_datascience_demos]]

==== Meeting with Drew and Neelesh about science planning for FY 2021 - 2022 ====

== - improving VCSN ==

1) step 1, back to 1972: 
	→ using analogs methods to derive composite fields with which to guide the ANUSPLIN interpolation 
	→ using ML methods (regression) accounting for e.g. topography or other ancillary variables 
	→ use NZCSM or the (in progress) NZ reanalsis project 
	→ comparing with e.g. image inpainting techniques ?  
	
2) step 2, back to 1950 
	→ using reanalysis data (ERA5) 
	→ using Image InPainting techniques 
	
3) → step 3, back to the early 20th Century (using the 20CR reanalysis) 

WR papers: 

1) contribution to 1st paper on methodology: subsidiary clustering based on surface variables (temperature and precipitation anomalies) 
option: mask out values for elevation > 1000m ? 

2) paper on predictability: using **MOTIF DETECTION:** see  https://github.com/ksanjeevan/ts-motif-detection and article: https://towardsdatascience.com/part-10-discovering-multidimensional-time-series-motifs-45da53b594bb, then look at precusors of sequences of WRs 

The modified code (i.e. print statements mainly) is working in [[/home/nicolasf/research/CPP/WRs/ts-motif-detection]]
