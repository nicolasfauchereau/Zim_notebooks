==== ICU draft PPT ====

@ICU 


Page 1: Need to great better graphics for the two dials (without the see-through background stuff) - will talk to Ben about that

Page 6: Change title of first legend to " October Forecast Decile Precipitation"

Page 6: Bottom plot - legend boxes same size on similar to boxes in other plot and move boxes/text further right towards margin

Pge 7: Change title of first legend to " October to December Forecast Decile Precipitation" (wrap in to two lines if need be)

Page 7: Bottom plot same as above

Page 8: Need to change legend titles: "October Probability of rainfall < 25th Percentile" and "October to December Probabilty of Rainfall <2th Percentile: (wrap over 2 lines if need be)

Page 9: Need to update description to add in Page 8 and new plots in Page 9. (Doug to do)

==== differences between tercile probabilities derived from empirical VS parametrized climatological terciles ====

@ICU 

see: **3_calculate_MME_probabilities_parametrized_climatologies.ipynb**

The differences are particularly marked for the middle tercile,

The conclusion is that the "official" ECMWF forecasts are closer to the forecasts derived using the *empirical* climatological terciles
than the *parametrized* climatological terciles

below are the "official" forecasts for OND 202, from ECMWF

which can be found at 

https://climate.copernicus.eu/charts/c3s_seasonal/


and then the *empirical* terciles derived probabilities

Then the *parametrized* terciles derived probabilities

The new code for making improved maps is in 

**3_calculate_MME_probabilities_parametrized_climatologies.ipynb**

and needs to be moved into a function, or functions (if needed for decile probabilistic forecast)
