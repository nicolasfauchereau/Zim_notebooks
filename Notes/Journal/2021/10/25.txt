==== ICU: recalculate the terciles probabilities over the hindcast period for validation ====

@ICU 

see in [[/home/nicolasf/operational/ICU/development/hotspots/notebooks/CDS/version_2]] 

calculate_ensemble_probabilities_for_hindcast_terciles.ipynb 

or **calculate_ensemble_probabilities_for_hindcast_terciles.py **

the climatologies are in 

[[/media/nicolasf/END19101/ICU/data/CDS/CLIMATOLOGY]] 

for monthly and seasonal values 

@TODO 

→ move this to the current folder with the notebooks (C3S) and calculate the complete climatologies for JMA and ECCC
→ check all the notebook used to calculate the verification scores, and move them in a separate folder for the generation of the figures for the paper 

→ list of figures:

1) situation map, with box for the domain(s) and the admin boundaries (for the calculation of the admin tercile table) 
2) ACC as a function of leadtime 
3) variability in ACC for leadtime 1 
4) ACC as a function of leadtime and initial month
4) correlation maps 
5) accuracy of tercile probabilistic forecasts (maps) 
6) ??? accuracy of probability below / above median ? 
6) accuracy of tercile probabilistic forecasts for selected sub-regional entities 

7) GPM IMERG climatology 
8) example of EAR Watch map 
9) example of ICU Water Stress outlook map
