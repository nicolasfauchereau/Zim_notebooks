==== ICU: processing of the C3S forecasts and derivation of the new products ====

in order: 

→ //1_download_rolling_hindcasts.ipynb //(rename to : **1_download_C3S_rolling_hindcasts.ipynb**) downloads the hindcasts for a corresponding months for all C3S GCMs, uses dask delayed to execute the download in parallel 
→ //2_download_latest_C3S_forecasts.ipynb//: download the latest, realtime forecasts from the CDS for all C3S GCMs, uses dask delayed to execute the download in parallel  
→ 3: //drive_GCM_hindcast_climatology_ops.ipynb// (rename to : **3_drive_C3S_GCMs_hindcast_climatologies_ops.ipynb**)  uses papermill to execute //GCMs_hindcast_climatology_ops.ipynb// (rename to **C3S_GCMs_hindcast_climatologies_ops.ipynb)**, whih calculates the monthly AND seasonal tercile, decile and percentile climatologies, derive the empirical quantiles, Not the parametrized quantiles ... one can pass a list of lags to calclulate the climatololgies for all months / seasons 

NOTE: to calculates the **parametrized** version of the climatological quantiles (terciles, deciles, percentiles) use C3S/drive_GCMs_hindcast_climatology_parametrized.ipynb 

→ 4: //3_calculate_MME_probabilities.ipynb// (rename to **4_calculate_C3S_MME_forecast_probabilities.ipynb**) to calculate the forecast probabilities for the latest forecasts from the C3S 

→ 5: maps of the terciles, deciles and percentiles (probability of rainfall being below the 25th percentile) 

	- C3S/4_map_MME_probabilistic_tercile_forecast.ipynb (rename to **5_map_MME_probabilistic_tercile_forecast.ipynb**) 
	- C3S/4_map_MME_probabilistic_decile_forecast.ipynb (rename to **5_map_MME_probabilistic_decile_forecast.ipynb**) 
	- C3S/4_map_MME_probabilistic_percentile_forecast.ipynb (rename to **5_map_MME_probabilistic_25th_percentile_forecast.ipynb**) 
	
→ 6: map the ICU "Water Stress Outlook": C3S///5_map_hotspots_experiments.ipynb// (rename to **6_map_ICU_Water_Stress_Outlook.ipynb**) 

== New Island Climate Update quantile probabilistic forecast table for the admin boundaries: ==

@TODO: move all the notebooks in the folder [[/home/nicolasf/operational/ICU/development/hotspots/code/ICU_Water_Watch/notebooks/ICU_forecast_table]]    

currently: 

in the folder **ICU_validation** 

→ //GCMs_admin_hindcast_climatologies_and_probabilities.ipynb// (rename to **ICU_forecast_table_GCMs_admin_hindcast_climatologies_and_probabilities.ipynb**): calculates the climatologies (parametrized or empirical) for the sub-regional time-series of precpitation anmounts for the admin areas, and calculate the percentile bins: This notebook is driven by drive_admin_GCMs_evaluation.ipynb (rename to **drive_GCMs_admin_hindcast_climatologies_and_probabilities.ipynb**

in the folder **C3S** 

**→ for the realtime forecasts**: see 

→ **drive_make_tercile_probs_table.ipynb**, which drives C3S/make_tercile_probs_table.ipynb, which, for each GCM, reads the forecasts, then reads the climatologies, which are all in the folder [[/home/nicolasf/operational/ICU/development/hotspots/code/ICU_Water_Watch/outputs/ICU_validation/admin/climatologies]] 

then 

→ drive_make_tercile_probs_table_MME.ipynb drives make_tercile_probs_table_MME.ipynb, which takes the individual forecasts from the GCMs and then calculates the MME probabilities 

do not forget to move the "operational' hindcast climatologies for all the GCMs from the operational folder to to the original (archive) folder 

i.e. every month the hindcasts are saved in [[/media/nicolasf/END19101/ICU/data/CDS/operational/hindcasts]] but need to be copied in [[/media/nicolasf/END19101/ICU/data/CDS]] in the corresponding GCM folder (containing the archived hindcasts) 















one can then use: Compile_MME_forecast_table.ipynb 

to compile the forecast table 

@TODO : Note that currently the sub-regional climatologies are parametrized (using the Gamma distribution), I need to redo all that using the empirical quantiles 




































→ make tercile probabiliy table for the
