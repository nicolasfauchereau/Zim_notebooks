==== ICU New Bulletin  template ====

see 

Hi Nico. Maybe catch up tomorrow morning. I'm trying to create the new ICU from Tristans October 1. A couple of thigs:

On page 2 the rainfall amounts and number of dry days show very similar patterns. I think we do the same as we've done for the drought indices and pick one (rainfall amounts) and do for 90 days / 30 days. That would allow us to talk about recent conditions as well as the longer 90 days situation. Will need to think of a new scale for the 30 day plot.

So we would have: TOP: Last 90 days cumulative rainfall ( mm), and BOTTOM: Last 30 days cumulative rainfall ( mm).

Page 3: Need to correct legend titles: "Early Action Rainfall ( EAR) Watch alert levels (90 day cumulative rainfall) / ( 30 day cumulative rainfall)

Page 4: Need to correct legend title: "Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) / (90 day cumulative rainfall) / (30 day cumulative rainfall)

Page 5: Need to correct legend title: "US Drought Monitor / (90 day cumulative rainfall) / (30 day cumulative rainfall)

Page 6: Will get back to you on probabilistic plots

Page 6/7: Bottom plots. Need legend title: [Month] Water Stress Outlook / Seasonal Water Stress Outlook. Reduce size of legend text to be consistent with other plots.
