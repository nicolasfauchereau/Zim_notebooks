==== ICU: validation of ICU admin areas forecast table ====

→ drive_admin_GCMs_evaluation.ipynb runs: 
→ GCMs_admin_hindcast_climatologies_and_probabilities.ipynb 

which calculates the admin areas climatologies 

→ drive_admin_MME_evaluation.ipynb runs: 
→ C3S_MME_ICU_admin_validation.ipynb 

which derives the validation accuracy (1993 - 2016) for the MME (calculated as the unweigthed average of the individual GCMs probabiilities) 

→ compile_MME_ICU_admin_validation_scores.ipynb

compile the MME validation scores for each country and creates a table such as below:
