==== ACC scores for ENSO phases, monthly and seasonal ====

see 

validation/validation_initial_deterministic_monthly.ipynb

validation/validation_initial_deterministic_seasonal.ipynb 

e.g. type of plots generated:

--------------------

==== probabilistic forecasts validation, using xskillscore ====

see **validation/validation_initial_probabilistic.ipynb** 

use Contingency method, which then allow the calculation of metrics such as Accuracy etc ... 

see e.g. accuracy calculated "manually" vs 

xs_table = xs.Contingency(verif_tercile_categories, dset_gcm_m, np.array([1,2,3,4]), np.array([1,2,3,4]), dim='time')
acc_xs = xs_table.accuracy()
acc_xs = acc_xs.compute()

"manual" () on the left, and using Contingency() then accuracy() on the right ... same thing 

other scores available: 

→ Contingency.heidke_score()
→ Contingency.peirce_score()
→ Contingency.gerrity_score()

can also do that accross ALL ENSEMBLE members once they are categorised ... 


Q: can we use https://xskillscore.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/xskillscore.brier_score.html#xskillscore.brier_score
