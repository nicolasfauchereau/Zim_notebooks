==== Neural Network Attribution Methods for Problems in Geoscience: A Novel Synthetic Benchmark Dataset ====

https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10005 

--------------------

==== Miniforge as an alternative to Anaconda / Miniconda ? ====

see https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge 


This repository holds a minimal installer for Conda specific to conda-forge. It is comparable to Miniconda, but with:

	conda-forge set as the default channel
	an emphasis on supporting various CPU architectures
	optional support for PyPy in place of standard Python (aka "CPython")
	optional support for Mamba in place of Conda
