==== Drew weather regimes: ====

discussion on "secondary" classification / clustering 

on Teams: 

"""so basically clustering done first using Euclidean Distance, after determining optimal number of clusters using Affinity Propagation, then within each cluster (all days belonging to a cluster) using multivariate (i.e. including surface variables such as precip and temp) and multi-metrics  -- Manhattan and other distances -- including those who can deal with categorical values, so we can include discretised (tercile or decile based) versions of the surface variables .... """

**Questions to ask Neelesh:** 
 

what reanalysis product he has used for the clustering (ERA5, NCEP2 ?)
	
what variable / level (Z1000 ?, Z850 ?) 

what geographical domain (bounds in latitude and longitude) 

what period the clustering has been done over (1979 - 2019 ? other ?)

what preprocessing applied: 

	daily 'raw' values or daily anomalies WRT to seasonal cycle ? 
	detrended or not ?
	Any other preprocessing (interpolation on another grid, etc)

What dimensionality reduction technique has been used, and the details: I assume he used PCA first, how many PCs or % of variance explained was kept ?

==== Geopandas 0.9.0 out ====

changelog https://geopandas.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docs/changelog.html

**geopandas.read_file** will now also automatically recognize zipped files
The **dissolve()** method now allows dissolving by no column (by=None) to create a union of all geometries 
The **GeoDataFrame.explode()** method now allows exploding based on a non-geometry column

--------------------

==== ICU development / hotspots ====

easy water stress: mask regions where past N months < 40% and forecast also < 40% 

--------------------

==== remote climate data with INTAKE ====

see examples: 

https://github.com/aaronspring/remote_climate_data

https://github.com/pangeo-data/pangeo-datastor

list of INTAKE plugins: https://intake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugin-directory.html 

example: 

import intake
cat = intake.open_catalog('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaronspring/remote_climate_data/master/master.yaml')

cat.walk() 

HadCRUT4 = cat.atmosphere.HadCRUT4.to_dask()
