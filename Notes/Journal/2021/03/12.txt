==== !!!! TODO: process Z850 ====

see [[/media/nicolasf/END19101/data/GCMs/processed/CDS/]] 

then run **make_GCM_and_targets_csv.ipynb** 

in [[/media/nicolasf/END19101/data/GCMs/downloads/ECMWF/Z850]] there is also TMEAN, WTF ? 

moving to TMEAN folder one level up 


--------------------

==== Complex Networks: ====

A python library for creating complex networks of geospatial time series data, with an accompanying Jupyter notebook containing an example with sea surface temperature data. 

see paper 

https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10091542/1/Gregory_wafd190107.pdf

see code https://github.com/William-gregory/ComplexNetworks cloned in [[/home/nicolasf/sources/ComplexNetworks]] 

also the code included to FORECAST sea ice extent using GPs leveraging the complex networks teleconnections uncovered using the methodology above: 

https://github.com/William-gregory/SeaIceExtentForecasting

also cloned into [[/home/nicolasf/sources]]

see also this repo: https://github.com/William-gregory/PRML with **PRML.ipynb** which contains coded examples, which i have written myself (William Gregory), outlining various fundamental statistical concepts related to pattern recognition and machine learning, as covered in both textbooks by Bishop, 2006 and Rasmussen & Williams, 2006.

With the addition of some more recent work into multi-task GPs from Stegle et al., 2011 and Rakitsch et al., 2013.

==== Tesseract and images to csv ====

https://github.com/artperrin/image2csv

https://github.com/madmaze/pytesseract 

could be of interest for Southern Weather Discovery ???
