==== ICU presentation ====

Trip down memory lane, to put the recent developments in the context of what we developed for the ICU along the years, because I think there could be opportunities for more synergies between the Bureau and us ...  

Familiar with the ICU, regional outlook bulletin for the Pacific 

In November 2014, we built on this idea of identifying Island groups at risk of drought (potential water stress), based on the past 6 months rainfall anomalies, and the next 3 months seasonal forecasts, applying some heuristic 

Initially the monitoring used the NASA TRMM product, for each Island group, I derived climatological quintiles (for land grid points only), and the realtime data, , was then classified in 5 categories (well below, below, near normal, above, well above) for the past 6 calendar months in realtime 

the tercile probabilistic outlook was based on the then METPI (Multi-model Ensemble Tool for the Pacific Islandsc) which made use of seasonal forecast products (charts) 

and we (Doug) developed a formula to derive a 'potential water stress' level based on the combination of the past 6 month category and the next 3 month most likely outcome according to METPI

In 2016, on the back of the 2015 - 2016 El Nino, Kasis Inape got in touch to see if I could help him with rainfall monitoring for PNG, developed (on my spare time):

towards the end 2018, we started developping the new ICU outlook based on GCM data from the CDS (Copernicus Data Store), this was made operational in **January 2019**

validation against several precipitation products: CMAP + MSWEP 2.

Early in 2020, following discussions with regional agencies, we started to plan the development a more refined product, that could identify potential hotspots within the Pacific region, based on the same idea of combining past rainfall anomalies (over different accumulation periods, from 30 days to a year) and the multi-model ensemble forecasts ... it coincided with the decommission of TRMM-TMPA
