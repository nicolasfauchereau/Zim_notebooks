**GeoPython conference 2021 and some stuff relevant to our discussions**

Hi everyone

Just wanted to point you to the schedule for the upcoming 2021 GeoPython conference: https://2021.geopython.net/schedule.html 

where I spotted a few talks that might be relevant: 

	→ Miguel Alvarez
	Predicting Traffic Accident Hotspots with Spatial Data Science	
	
	→ Vishnu Prasad J S, Ujaval Gandhi
	Travel Time Prediction for Urban Travel using Uber Movement and OpenStreetMap
	
	→ Ye Hong
	Trackintel: An open-source python library for human mobility modeling and analysis 
	
The latter points to this library: https://github.com/mie-lab/trackintel which could be useful to analyse mobility patterns (also relevant is https://anitagraser.github.io/movingpandas/, an earlier library for handling movement data) 

The ticket for the conference is about 200NZD, and gives access to the video recordings of the talks, which I could not find online for the last year's conference, so I guess they are not actually available if you don't register, which is a bummer ...
