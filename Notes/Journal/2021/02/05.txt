==== ICU paper: ====

**open data and opensource software for the development of multi-model objective probabilistic seasonal climate forecasts in the Pacific** 
Fauchereau, D. Ramsay, D. Lorrey 

--------------------

==== sequences of regimes using itertools ? ====

from itertools import groupby

s = 'aaaabbbcca'

s = list(s) 


for k, g in groupby(s): 
	print(k) 
	print(list(g))

a
['a', 'a', 'a', 'a']
b
['b', 'b', 'b']
c
['c', 'c']
a
['a']
