==== finding the path to an executable in Python ====

use 

shutil.which(executable) 

--------------------

==== script to shift the longitudes in a shapefile to go from -180 → 180 to 0 → 360 ====

see [[~/bin/shift_shapefile.py]] 

Note that it does not get rid of the bloody dateline, so will need to do something about it e.g. for the EEZ if we ever re-generate the shapefiles ... 

--------------------

==== GADM shapefiles for countries etc .... ====

https://gadm.org/index.html 

GADM provides maps and spatial data for all countries and their sub-divisions. You can browse our maps or download the data to make your own maps.  

--------------------

==== read and clip shapefiles with other geometries ====

see: [[~/Jupyter_notebooks/Geospatial_Python/read_and_clip_shapefiles.html]]

illustrating how one can use geometries to clip shapefiles ... 

--------------------

DL catch up with Neelesh and Raghav 

Neelesh: encodings (vanilla autoi-encorder for climate indices, resnet architecture for SSTs) fed into KNN give good results for NNI rainfall 
Raghav: LSTM on climate indices, also good results ... 

~ 50% accuracy for NNI rainfall over period 2015 - 2019 (for seasonal values) 

--------------------

==== reading a ZIPPED shapefile with Python / Geopandas ====

shape = gpd.read_file('zip:///home/nicolasf/Desktop/gadm36_NZL_shp.zip')
