Composite of SWH anommalies for the 9  ERA5 circulation regimes

@ERA5 @SWH @CPP  

see in [[/home/nicolasf/research/WRs_and_waves/notebooks]] 

**read_ERA_SWH.ipynb** 

**NOTE**: re-downloading the whole dataset, and calculating the daily SWH maxima from the hourly values, see

==== ICU validation paper ====

→ deterministic validation: ACC 
→ probabilistic validation: calculate quartile probabilities, see 
	- C3S/calculate_C3S_GCMs_hindcast_quartile_probabilities.ipynb
	- C3S/drive_calculate_C3S_GCMs_hindcast_quartile_probabilities.ipynb to run it from papermill 
	
The quartile probabilities are saved in

===== Graph Neural Networks in Tensorflow =====

@ML @DL @network @graph @GNN

Not been able to install it however

==== Idea for climate networks ====

@network @graph 

Before widepread droughts, how do characteristics of the local / regional climate networks change (betweeness, etc): i.e. can we detect signals in the properties of the climate 
networks themselves prior to significant, impactful climate events 

see library pyunicorn: https://github.com/pik-copan/pyunicorn 

installed in environment `graph` 

examples in [[/home/nicolasf/sources/pyunicorn/examples/tutorials]] 

→ climate_network.ipynb works ! 

**NOTE**: see: https://gist.github.com/kuchaale/0d3c713d0b00783f2b2a0474a6396cc8 to add a cyclic point to an xarray dataset
