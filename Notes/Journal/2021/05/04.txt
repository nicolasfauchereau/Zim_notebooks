==== insert image (logo or other) in matplotlib plot ====

# Imports
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib as mpl

# read image file
with mpl.cbook.get_sample_data(r"C:\path\to\file\image.png") as file:
arr_image = plt.imread(file, format='png')

# Draw image
axin = ax.inset_axes([105,-145,40,40],transform=ax.transData)    # create new inset axes in data coordinates
axin.imshow(arr_image)
axin.axis('off')
