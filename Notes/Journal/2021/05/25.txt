Multi-directed graphs in networkx

**# Directed Multi-Graph**
DM = nx.MultiDiGraph()
DM.add_edge('B','A')
DM.add_edge('B','C')
# Check
DM.is_multigraph()
# True

==== Movie plot ====

Movie plot idea: A greedy, violent alien species lands on earth, starts digging fossil carbon buried millions of years ago, knowingly messes with the natural carbon cycle, uses sophisticated brainwashing techniques to sell it as inevitable and embarks in massive scale social engineering projects to make humans more and more dependent, destroys entire ecosystems and poisons millions of people, perverts or straight up overthrows democracies across the globe, buys politicians, silences and threatens human scientists raising the alarm ... crazy to think humans would not revolt right ? ... right ??
