redo dry runs analysis selecting longer dry spells (20 days ?) 

see: **notebooks/read_VCSN_do_extremes_analysis_dryruns.ipynb** 

For the paper: 

That the occurence of extremes over NZ is determined by interactions between flow and topography seems self-evident, but to what extent the occurence of extremes is dominated by certain flow patterns ? this paper attempts to answer this question by mapping extremes to circulation regimes in a novel way.

James Sturman some types of Kriging are called Gaussian processes in other communities and... there are some good toolboxes for these in Python (and certainly in R but I don't know them (smile)):

→ GPy (the ancestor https://gpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
→ GPflow (accelerated with Tensorflow https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow, quite useful if you need non-Gaussian likelihood or large scale regression using inducing-points, can use a GPU)
→ GPyTorch (acceleratd using PyTorch https://gpytorch.ai/, also very scalable, even more if your data are already on a grid, can use a GPU)
	

Now I don't know about the specificities of Empirical Bayesian Kriging so... it might not be possible to replicate the method using these toolboxes
