====== 03 TODO May 2021 ======

===== TODO list May 2021 =====

==== ICU ====

[ ] finish plotting code 
	[*] EAR Watch 
	[*] USDM 
	[*] decile (percentile) values 
	[*] precipitation accumulation 
	[*] precipitation anomalies 
	[*] number of dry days 
	[*] days since last rain
[ ] get in touch with Bernard → operationalisation 
[>] re-factor in different modules: 

	→ GPM 
	→ C3S 
	→ utils 
	→ plot 
	→ verification 
	
see in [[~/operational/ICU/development/hotspots/code/ICU_Water_Watch/src]] 

and repo on github: https://github.com/nicolasfauchereau/ICU_Water_Watch 


==== Smart Ideas ====

[ ] move T2M and then other variables in same format as ICU GCMs so can use **get_one_GCM** / **get_GCMs** functions 
[*] https://github.com/nicolasfauchereau/ClimateBench started a repo
[*] get in touch with  https://carlgogo.github.io/ about   https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU21/EGU21-12253.html (Deep learning-based downscaling of seasonal forecasts over the Iberian Peninsula) 
[ ] start writing up report 
[ ] Paper with Geoff Kaine: 

Note that the end of May deadline is a 'soft' deadline, actual reports to MBIE are due end of August 

Report Template by Janine: 

see in [[/home/nicolasf/research/Smart_Ideas/reporting/end_of_project_report]] for template 



==== CPP ====

[ ] get list of weather regimes from Neelesh 
[ ] prepare VCSN data (rainfall and min and max temperature anomalies) 
[ ] run xclim (https://xclim.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) on the daily data 

NOTE THAT XCLIM now contain some modules and function for **bias adjustment**: 

see https://xclim.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sdba_api.html#bias-adjustment-algos 

includes 
→ Principal components inspired adjustment: https://xclim.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sdba_api.html#xclim.sdba.adjustment.PrincipalComponents
and
→ quantile mapping:  https://xclim.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sdba_api.html#xclim.sdba.adjustment.EmpiricalQuantileMapping 

==== Proposals ====

[ ] "Linking windows of opportunity for skillful subseasonal to seasonal forecasts to the user's decision context, a systems' approach" 

	impetus: 
	
	→ Kaine et al examined the decision making process and constraints of end users of environmental forecasts with the framework of systems theory 
	→ found error controls, anticipation etc 
	→ possibility of switching between types if / when skillful forecasts are available 
	→ on the other hand, examination of skill of weather, subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) forecasts reveal windows of opportunity 
	
	need to link the 2 c
