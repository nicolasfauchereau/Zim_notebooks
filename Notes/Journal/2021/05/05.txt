==== Weather Regimes ====

notebook to download, read, process the NCEP1 Z1000 data, then do Affinity Propagation then K-Means clustering, and composites, as well 
as reconstruction of the clusters centroids from the centroids in PC space:

==== generation of consolidated VCSN datasets for ZESPRI ====

==== modelling wind power generation with TPOT (AutoML) ====

==== A database of global storm surge reconstructions ====

code in Python to do some ML

==== REXA (Regimes Extreme Analysis) on VCSN and circulation regimes over New Zealand ====

Notebook: **read_VCSN_do_extremes_analysis.ipynb** 

in [[/home/nicolasf/research/CPP/WRs/notebooks/]]

probably enough material already for a paper, maybe re-do using ERA5 ? 

**methodology:**

Determining the optimal number of circulation regimes: Affinity Propagation
