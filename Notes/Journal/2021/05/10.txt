==== beyond adaptation: climate science for earth's stewardship ====

Take Adam Sobel paper:

Climate change veloicity is beyond capacity of individual organisms, poppulations and ecostystemns to adapt 

A prime example is coral reef 

If humanity if going to adapt, I make the argument that we will have to assist transitions of ecosystems to ensure maximum biodiversity, relocate, select, even potentially genetically engineer 

to do that we 

In that sense, we will become part of 'Nature', but with a twist that the definition of Nature needs to be expanded, it is probably the first - and last - chance we have to be truly part of nature
