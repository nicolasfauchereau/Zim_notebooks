==== Paper: open data and open-source software for the development of climate services and climate forecasts in the Pacific region. ====

@ICU 

Open data and open source software 

Introduction 

Climate change adaptation, 

Availability of forecasts and outlooks at different scales 

monthly to seasonal forecasts 

One model that has been successful is open data and open source software 

demonstrated 

We argue in this paper that the promise / potential of monthly and seasonal forecasts can be truly be realises when the information can be incoporated in larger climate services systems, i.e. when monthly / seasonal forecasts become one element in larger climate intelligence systems. 

We give the example here of a simple system which combines near realtime satellite rainfall estimates and monthly to seasonal ensemble probabilistic forecasts, based on simple heuristics, and developed with the goal to highlight regions at potential for water stress in the Pacific region. This system (The Island Climate "Water Watch") is inspired by and extends the "Early Rainfall Action" (EAR) watches implemented by various Pacific Islands National Meteorological Services (PI-NMSs) and some regional organisations.
