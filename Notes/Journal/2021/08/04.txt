==== Smart Ideas workshop ====

== Science Excellence: ideas ==

proposal will advance global understanding of what controls skill of ocean / atmosphere forecasts at different time-scales ... 

NZ particularly suited because by the virtue of its location and oceanic environment it is a challenging environment / focus 

need to leverage some review papers (windows + ensemble) and show this is at the forefront of research questions globally and reflection on end-users needs (windows of opportunity) and 

moreover, will leverage emerging methods interpretable machine learning for the climate sciences, which use neural networks for the purpose of identifying signals 

science goal: identify windows of opportunities (when and where, for what time horizon) and change the way environmental forecasts are consumed ... better understand the culture of end-users of environmental forecast (what type of decisions they make when and why, in what context) and how that can align with windows of opportunities 

goal is to develop a methodology / framework which thus can be applied to different groups of end-users in order to nudge end-users to different way to consume forecasts, which is more of a dialogue (nature: when these windows open, culture

== risks ==

risks: mainly engagement with end-users, cultural inertia, Matauranga 

need to identify a end-user group which is already at the forefront of innovation, which is already embracing new technologies, new ways of doing things, which is ready to change, which has embraced change ... 

this is challenging, 

but ZESPRI: ? innovation vineyards, data science team, also, orchard management is suited to the application of systems framework that we propose to use in this project to identify opportunities to align opened windows of opportunity for skillful forecasts and decision context 

tight collaboration with their data science team 

DOC ??? 

== alignment ==

context of the research 

leveraging current research investments ? HPCF, NIWA NZENS ... GEFS (subseasonal), C3S (seasonal) ... this research project will leverage all these 

leveraging recent methodological advances in XAI 

=== Team ===

Neelesh, Kameron ?  
Trevor, Stuart 
coms: excellent team in Auckland (Chris, Ben, Nava ...) 

== VM ==

??? 

traditional calendar ? 

a central 

incorporation of Matauranga in the science excellence 

ENSO impacts: how Matauranga views variability ? how was this knowlege incorporated in the traditional, environmental cues forecasting that Maori did ? how did that articulate with the traditional calendars .... was there a concept of windows of opportinties, what concept - if any - of time-scales was integrated ... 

opportunity to advance science ? 

what methodologies 

== Team ==

what internationals ?

describe the skill set needed FIRST, then demonstrate how the team and its management will provide these skills 

XAI team ? 

AI institute ? 

Overseas collaboration necessary ... 

== Impact ==

Delivered from behavior changes from end users 

tuned to current natural climate conditions 

immediate impact: take from 

Mariotti, A., and Coauthors, 2020: Windows of Opportunity for Skillful Forecasts Subseasonal to Seasonal and Beyond. Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 101, E608–E625, https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-18-0326.1.


Gains could be obtained by increasingly developing
prediction tools and metrics that strategically target these specific windows of opportunity. Across
the globe, reevaluating forecasts in this manner could find value in forecasts previously discarded
as not skillful. Users’ expectations for prediction skill could be more adequately met, as they are
better aware of when and where to expect skill and if the prediction is actionable. Given that
there is still untapped potential, in terms of process understanding and prediction methodologies,
it is safe to expect that in the future forecast opportunities will expand. Process research and the
development of innovative methodologies will aid such progress.
