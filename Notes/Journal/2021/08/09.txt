==== fix libmesa issue on Ubuntu ====

@linux @ubuntu 

First of all, one can boot in safe mode and get to a terminal by CTRL - ALT - F2 

then, in the terminal, 

sudo apt-get clean 
sudo apt-get autoclean
sudo apt autoremove
sudo apt-get -f install


sudo dpkg --audit

returns the offending packages 

to reinstall: 

sudo apt-get install -f --reinstall libglapi-mesa:amd64

One thing that could be in the @SI report: 

**However, some of the fundamental assumptions** behind **CNNs** are not well suited for seasonal and long range forecasting:

→ 	Parameter-shared convolutions lead to translational equivariance, meaning that if the input is moved, its output representation will move by the same amount. In earth science applications however, the location of a certain pattern is very important. For example, sea surface temperature anomalies occurring in the tropical Pacific should be treated differently from those occurring in the north Atlantic.
→ CNNs build representations from spatially close regions of the input, leading to a spatial locality bias. Many climate qaphenomena however, are driven by global interactions.
CNNs account for large-scale patterns only through deep layers, which misses the importance of modeling predominantly large-scale patterns.
→ CNNs need to use all grid cells of the input. This makes them inflexible in cases where some regions of the input are known to not be needed and must be masked out for the CNN (e.g., as in this work, all terrestrial locations could be discarded when only using oceanic variables).
