==== ICU: C3S forecasts download, processing and mapping s ====

1) download the hindcast data for each GCM for the current initial month: 


C3S/1_download_C3S_rolling_hindcasts.ipynb 

NOTE: make sure that the mapping between GCM name and system is correct, this mapping is defined by the dictionnary "dict_systems" on cell 14

currently the mapping is: 

dict_systems = OD(
				ECMWF=5, # SEAS5, hindcast complete 
				UKMO=600, # note: only for system 14 is hindcast complete
				METEO_FRANCE=8, # note: only for system 7 is hindcast complete
				DWD=21, # GCFS2.1, hindcast complete 
				CMCC=35, # SPSv3.5, hindcast complete 
				NCEP=2,# CFSv2, hindcast complete 
				JMA=2, # CPS2, hindcast complete
				ECCC_GEM_NEMO=2, # GEM-NEMO, hindcast incomplete
				ECCC_CanCM4i=3, # CanCM4i, hindcast incomplete
				)
