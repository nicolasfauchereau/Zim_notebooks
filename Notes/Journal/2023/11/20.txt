Neural NWPs at NIWA and elsewhere 

@NIWA 

see email from / to Tristan 

//Hey Nico!//

//Just hijacking this a little bit….//

//That would be excellent – I’m trying to put together a bit of a strategy meeting of neural weather models (NWM) at NIWA on the 14th Dec.//

//Neelesh, Gemma Mason, Nava, and potentially Jess Robertson (new head of Data Science and HPC) would be in attendance, and I was hoping you would be able to attend too?  The rough agenda would be://

	//Update from Gemma on our progress with NWMs at NIWA//
	//How we have been collaborating into the wider UM partnership and plans going forward with this collaboration (papers planned, etc)//
	//What is holding us back (hardware, capacity, etc)//
	//How we see the future of NWMs at NIWA//
	//Other potential collaborators (Scripps)//

//No time set in stone as yet… but it would probably be ~2 hours. Are you interested in attending?//

//Cheers,//

//Tristan//

response: 

//Awesome Tristan, thanks for the update ... curious about their use of LLMs//

//re. Bodeker Scientific, have had a look at https://www.bodekerscientific.com/projects/deepweather and https://www.deepweather.org.nz/home, not sure where it's going, but noticed with interest https://www.redskyai.com/ which seems to be some kind of spin up of Bodeker (see https://www.redskyai.com/our-team) ? They also have a partnership with the Waikato Uni (Albert Bifet) who's behind the TAIAO programme///

//cheers//
