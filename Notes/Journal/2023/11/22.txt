 My research at NASA-JPL as a Student Intern presents a unique climate change simulation toolbox that merges multiple climate models and observations using Pseudo-Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) and other techniques. It allows researchers to select optimal model weights for accurate forecasts and flexibility in addressing various climatic inquiries.  

also cloned in [[~/repos]] 

see in particular:

which seems to apply to both forecasts and projections
