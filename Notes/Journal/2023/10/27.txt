Riskthinking.AI CEO and Founder Dr. Ron Dembo said:

	“Our pioneering methodology enables investors to use the uncertainty inherent in climate modeling as a strength to support better investment decisions. We don’t rely on a single model or scenario when managing risks or defining a strategy. Our outputs consider climate projections from 51 leading climate research centers and universities to capture a broad range of possible future outcomes.”
