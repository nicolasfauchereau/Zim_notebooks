==== PyETo ====

PyETo is a Python package for calculating reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo), sometimes referred to as potential evapotranspiration (PET). The library provides numerous functions for estimating missing meteorological data.

Three methods for estimating ETo/PET are implemented:

	FAO-56 Penman-Monteith (Allen et al, 1998)
	Hargreaves (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985)
	Thornthwaite (Thornthwaite, 1948)
