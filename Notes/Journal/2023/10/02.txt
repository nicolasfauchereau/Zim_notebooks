==== PyETo ====

PyETo is a Python package for calculating reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo), sometimes referred to as potential evapotranspiration (PET). The library provides numerous functions for estimating missing meteorological data.

Three methods for estimating ETo/PET are implemented:

	FAO-56 Penman-Monteith (Allen et al, 1998)
	Hargreaves (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985)
	Thornthwaite (Thornthwaite, 1948)

==== Interaction between dry and hot extremes at a global scale using a cascade modeling framework ====

cascade modeling framework relies on network representation ...

""Climate change amplifies dry and hot extremes, yet the mechanism, extent, scope, and temporal scale of causal linkages between dry and hot extremes remain underexplored. Here using the concept of system dynamics, we investigate cross-scale interactions within dry-to-hot and hot-to-dry extreme event networks and quantify the magnitude, temporal-scale, and physical drivers of cascading effects (CEs) of drying-on-heating and vice-versa, across the globe. We find that locations exhibiting exceptionally strong CE (hotspots) for dry-to-hot and hot-to-dry extremes generally coincide. However, the CEs differ strongly in their timescale of interaction, hydroclimatic drivers, and sensitivity to changes in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum and background aridity. The CE of drying-on-heating in the hotspot locations reaches its peak immediately driven by the compounding influence of vapor pressure deficit, potential evapotranspiration, and precipitation. In contrast, the CE of heating-on-drying peaks gradually dominated by concurrent changes in potential evapotranspiration, precipitation, and net-radiation with the effect of vapor pressure deficit being strongly controlled by ecosystem isohydricity and background aridity. Our results help improve our understanding of the causal linkages and the predictability of compound extremes and related impacts."" 

We assess the casual interaction between dry and hot extreme events across the globe using a probabilistic framework motivated by a system dynamics approach24,25,26,27,28. We design two independent cross-scale (temporal) interaction networks24,27 that represent the event-to-event (dry-to-hot and hot-to-dry event) cascades. The dry extreme events are calculated based on daily root-zone-soil-moisture (RZSM), whereas the hot extreme events are calculated based on daily maximum 2 m air temperature (Tmax) anomalies for each location across the globe. Three sets of thresholds, 1%, 5%, and 10% of daily climatological RZSM, and 99%, 95%, and 90% of daily climatological Tmax were used to identify the dry and hot extreme events, respectively.

Transition to unstable state for dairy and beef in NZ → need to diversify proteins sources etc 

concept of climate niche, or safe climatic space 

introduce variability / variance 

if 2 out of 5 years are bad: what does that mean ...

combine heat stress and water stress 

create matrix 

y-axis = temp + rain category (based on percentiles) 
x-axis = year 
value = % of pasture (need land use data) under stress 
roll this matrix from now to 2100
