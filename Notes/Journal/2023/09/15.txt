**Main question**

To what extent is emissions information available as open data?

**Overall justification of the indicator**

New Zealand's Greenhouse Gas Inventory is produced each year as part of New Zealand's obligations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol. The inventory is the key source of evidence on New Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions trends. New Zealand's inventory data are used for both international and domestic reporting(1). The Inventory measures New Zealand's progress against obligations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol. The Inventory adheres to the UNFCCC reporting guidelines and the international methodology guidelines set out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The Inventory is the official source of New Zealand's emissions and removals data and is reported annually to the UNFCCC. It is also the basis by which progress towards targets is determined. Data is available from 1990, in line with international reporting requirements. Emissions and removals projections are also produced and reported every two years(2). The Inventory contains information about sectors (Agriculture, Energy, Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU), Waste, Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) and Other (Tokelau), as well as Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry under the Kyoto Protocol (KP-LULUCF)(3). It contains detailed information on sources of greenhouse gas emissions and details of land use effects on emissions(4). Since the Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act 2019 came into force, however, NZ has also begun tracking progress against our domestic targets(5).

==== Energy storage solutions to decarbonize electricity through enhanced capacity expansion modelling ====

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-023-01340-6 

To meet ambitious global decarbonization goals, electricity system planning and operations will change fundamentally. With increasing reliance on variable renewable energy resources, energy storage is likely to play a critical accompanying role to help balance generation and consumption patterns. As grid planners, non-profit organizations, non-governmental organizations, policy makers, regulators and other key stakeholders commonly use capacity expansion modelling to inform energy policy and investment decisions, it is crucial that these processes capture the value of energy storage in energy-system decarbonization. Here we conduct an extensive review of literature on the representation of energy storage in capacity expansion modelling. We identify challenges related to enhancing modelling capabilities to inform decarbonization policies and electricity system investments, and to improve societal outcomes throughout the clean energy transition. We further identify corresponding research activities that can help overcome these challenges and conclude by highlighting tangible real-world outcomes that will result from pursuing these research activities.

==== EU-27 ecological footprint was primarily driven by food consumption and exceeded regional biocapacity from 2004 to 2014 ====

 Nature Food 

https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-023-00843-5 


The European Union (EU) plans to decarbonize the region by 2050. As highlighted by the Green Deal and Farm to Fork Strategy, food systems are essential for this transition. Here we investigate the resource dependence and carbon emissions of the EU-27’s food systems from 2004 to 2014 via an ecological footprint (EF)-extended multi-regional input–output approach, accounting for demand and supply (including trade), and considering multiple externalities. Food contributes towards almost a third of the region’s EF, and appropriates over half of its biocapacity. Average reliance on biocapacity within national borders decreased, while reliance on intra-EU biocapacity increased; yet a quarter of the biocapacity for food consumption originates from non-EU countries. Despite a reduction in both total EF and food EF over the study period, EU-27 residents demand more from nature than the region’s ecosystems can regenerate—highlighting the need for new or strengthened food and trade policies to enable a transformation to sustainable EU food systems.
