Beck, Hylke E.; E. Zimmermann, Niklaus; McVicar, Tim R.; Vergopolan, Noemi; Berg, Alexis; Wood, Eric F. (2018): Present and future Köppen-Geiger climate classification maps at 1-km resolution

https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018214

The present and future Köppen-Geiger classification maps and the corresponding confidence maps are freely available for download at (Data Citation 1) and www.gloh2o.org/koppen. The maps are stored in GeoTIFF format as unsigned 8-bit integers. We also provide a legend file (legend.txt) linking the numeric values in the maps to the Köppen-Geiger climate symbols and providing the color scheme used for displaying the maps in the current study (adapted from Peel et al.21). The maps are referenced to the World Geodetic Reference System 1984 (WGS 84) ellipsoid and made available at three resolutions (0.0083°, 0.083°, and 0.5°; approximately 1 km, 10 km, and 50 km at the equator, respectively). The classifications are upscaled from 0.0083° to 0.083° and 0.5° using majority resampling and the confidence levels using bilinear averaging. Table 3 presents the file naming convention. The maps can be visualized and analyzed using most Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software (e.g., QGIS, ArcGIS, and GRASS).
