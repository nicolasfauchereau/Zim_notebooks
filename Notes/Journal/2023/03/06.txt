==== compound extremes proposal ====

consider vulnerability of infrastructure and socio-economic systems (including infrastructure) to different types of compound extreme events 

e.g. in the context of January floods 

compound diachronic weather extremes: first flooding due to atmospheric weather, then cyclone. Taking place within the context of climate extremes: La Nina and Marine Heatwaves. Spatial connection, slash from forestry → downstream destruction of infrastructure and properties, direct and indirect economic losses due to transport disruptions ... 

estimates of cost is made *after the fact* ... our work will allow the anticipation of such risk profiles. We will focus on the compound extremes identified in a large ensemble of simulations that are the most likely, under SSP 370.
