==== MSWEP update for the ICU ====

@ICU @MSWEP 

Note: 

in  [[/home/nicolasf/operational/ICU/development/hotspots/code/ICU_Water_Watch/scripts/GPM]] 

I have changed the script **GPM_process.py**: now when making the mask, subset = False, meaning that the resulting datasets are not clipped to the boundaries of the merged Pacific Island countries EEZs

Problem with MSWEP updates: nothing has changed since the day before yesterday (15 Feb) 

The 3 hourly files (see https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XBonFS0_t3aSM_C4CYobwsN-spmj29vo) 

have only been updated for day 45 hour 09 (i.e. hour 12, 15, 18 and 21 missing) 

So it seems the delay to realtime is more like 3 days... 

~~UPDATE: On the Friday 17 at 9 AM (so 8 PM UTC on Thursday the 16), the file with DOY 45 (2023, 2, 14) has been made available on the shared drive~~ 

Also problem with the climatological percentiles, need to recalculate and include: 

percentile 0.02 (for the USDI D4 [exceptional drought] category)
percentile 0.05 (for the "severely dry" EAR watch category)
