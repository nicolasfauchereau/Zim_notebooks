**Methods:**

1. Datasets (OISSTA, CDS, ERSST), feel free to copy content from your ICU paper.

2. Validation metrics (e.g. RMSE, correlation, binary accuracy for marine heatwaves)

3. Stratification by season.

**Results:**

//section 1//

MME spatial plot for a given lead time (e.g. 3 months) to illustrate the spatial variability in model skill. Maybe subplots to also show the poorer skill in the JJA period. 

//section 2//

**a**. MME correlation plot – but again stratified for different seasons. Two plots come to mind. This would paint a “New Zealand wide” measure of accuracy.
Make sure you also have persistence in your plots too? What do you think. You could probably write a bit of a story here.

**b**. Stratify the accuracy as a function of ENSO phase?

//section 3//

Site Specific plots of the model skill at various locations, ranking the different GCMs for different seasons.
It would be nice to compare it to persistence also. This plot might show that some GCMs are more skilful in some areas than others.

Locations (approx.)

	Pelorus Sound: 41.1628° S, 173.8632° E
	Golden Bay: 40.6548° S, 172.8210° E
	Coromandel: 36.7587° S, 175.4981° E
	Opotikii: 38.0123° S, 177.2871° E

//section 4// 

Marine heatwave accuracy for all 9 GCMs

a. Evaluate the skill of the 9 GCMs (on average for New Zealand) – binary accuracy score across all grid points in New Zealand. Evaluate this as a function of lead-time and season (see example plot below).

b. If the skill of the MME is far greater – only use the MME when making a plot.

c. Evaluate the skill of the marine heatwave accuracy for the 4 locations (show a similar plot to that of the above).

d. Probabilistic accuracies (we might not have time to do this right not) – look at evaluation metrics (e.g. CRPS) on xskillscore
