δ-MAPS is a method that identifies the semi-autonomous components (i.e., patterns) of a spatiotemporal climate field and studies their weighted and potentially lagged interactions. The components of the system are modeled as spatially contiguous (in physical space), possibly overlapping, homogeneous domains. To the best of our knowledge, δ-MAPS is the first method that can identify spatially contiguous and possibly overlapping clusters (i.e., domains). At a second step, δ-MAPS infers a directed and weighted network between the identified domains. Edge direction captures the temporal ordering of events while the weight associated to each edge captures the magnitude of interaction between domains.

The framework can be used also as a preprocessing step for running causal algorithms on climate time series. Causal graph discovery often benefits from dimensionality reduction. Domains signals (i.e., time series) identified by δ-MAPS can then be fed to causal discovery algorithms (e.g., https://jakobrunge.github.io/tigramite/) to identify causal linkages.

==== Work on the processing of MSWEP ====

@MSWEP 

→ **recode_SP_domain_netcdfs.ipynb**: recode all the files in [[/media/nicolasf/END19101/ICU/data/MSWEP/Daily/subsets_nogauge/SP]]  so that they follow the convention 

**MSWEP_Daily_YYYY-MM-DD.nc** 

→ **extract_country_domains_MSWEP_NRT.ipynb**: extract the domains (Tokelau, Tuvalu, the Kiribati and the South Pacific [SP]) from the NRT files (in [[/media/nicolasf/END19101/ICU/data/glo2ho/MSWEP280/NRT/Daily/]]) and saves in [[/media/nicolasf/END19101/ICU/data/MSWEP/Daily/subsets_nogauge/]] 

→ **extract_time-series.ipynb** extract time-series for point locations in MSWEP, see **UNESCO_and_IWRM/Stations_for_extractions.csv**
