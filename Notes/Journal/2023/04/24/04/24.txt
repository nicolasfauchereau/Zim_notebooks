Kia Ora Annabell 

I have now read the offer. Ahead of our discussion on Wednesday, and in the interest of time, I have a few of questions I thought I would ask upfront: 

1) The expected start date is 29 May. While my contractual notice period at NIWA is 4 weeks, I am deeply embedded in many projects, some of which will require very significant effort to hand over, involving coaching, and given other commitments 4 weeks would be too short. Is there a possibility to push the start date to either the 21 June (a Wednesday) or the 24 (Monday) ? 

2) The employment agreement mentions that the position will be based in Hamilton, but might involve overseas travel. In the first few years upon joining NIWA I spent a lot of time travelling abroad for conferences, workshops and symposiums. I managed to scale this down over the past couple of year, with promises made to my family that I would not take in any new position that would require me to travel overseas. I am also reluctant to fly because I am trying to reduce my carbon footprint, and reducing air travel is a significant way to do this. Would you be able to give me more clarity on the expected frequency of such travels ? 

3) I would like a more comprehensive description of what the role entails, how often I am expected to be in Auckland and engage in in person meetings, who I will be reporting to as my team leader most of the time, whether this position has reports (i.e. will I be expected to manage staff ?), what is the level of clients-facing interactions and does this also entails domestic travels ?

Thank you

Best regards 

Dr. Nicolas Fauchereau
