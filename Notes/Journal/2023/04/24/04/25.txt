==== ETCCDI indices using the CDO python 'bindings' ====

https://github.com/Peter-Gibson/climate/blob/CLIMATE-937/examples/ETCCDI_precip.py 

https://github.com/AusClimateService/indices

uses ICCLIM, which is already what I am using, see ICCLIM in https://icclim.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html 

see also: 

https://github.com/AusClimateService/indices/blob/main/run_icclim.py 

and

==== CMIP6, processing of the EC-Earth3 - CCAM downscaled data ====

see: EC-Earth3_CCAM_to_VCSN/notebooks/evaluate_EC-Earth3_BCSD_outputs_from_merged_dset_v2.ipynb 

Maybe change the chunking of the dataset, might be the solution for speed up

right now the merged dataset is 

merged_dset = merged_dset.chunk(dict(time=-1, lat=10, lon=10)) 

could increase the size of the chunks along the lat and lon dimensions

==== spatial selection ====
