I don't believe in "Time Management"

One of the key strategies is shifting to prioritizing outcomes rather than time. Instead of focusing on the number of hours worked (or tasks completed), leaders should focus on their desired results. This requires setting clear goals for each project or task. By communicating clear metrics for success and proposed outcomes, business leaders can provide their team with a clear sense of purpose and direction.

==== Budget 2023 ====

@PwC 

Spending $1.9b from the $3.6b Climate Emergency Response Fund, which can only be spent on emissions reductions, and - as of late last year - adaptation measures

$100m fund to help councils invest in future flood resilience

$50 million for distributed renewable energy projects in isolated communities

$39.2 million in improving the mapping of New Zealand's coastline and identifying coastal areas at significant risk of climate-related hazards and natural disasters.

$38 million on design of Emissions Trading Scheme and centralised exchange for New Zealand Unit trading

$32.5 million to accelerate the adoption of green hydrogen

$24.7 million to improve data on impacts of climate change and adaptation and mitigation

$300 million in new money for the green bank Green Investment Finance (already announced)

On the CAH radar screen…

	You will have seen Budget 2023 announced yesterday. Big news for NIWA was the $400 million earmarked for the creation of three multi-institution research hubs that will “bring scientists closer together to increase collaboration, ensure better use of expensive equipment and facilities, positioning New Zealand to meet complex challenges and seize economic opportunities.”
		The climate change and disaster resilience hub will bring together expertise from the NIWA, GNS Science, Victoria University of Wellington, Massey University and others to look at issues like climate change and disaster resilience as part of a national centre for research on oceans, climate and hazards.
		An additional $51 million in operational spending has been allocated for this project for the coming four years.

New Science and Innovation Hubs, backed by $400 million capital investment, plus **more than 260 additional researchers and PhD students**


	Budget 2023 also supports new talent through a $55.2 million investment in research fellowships and to train more PhD students. These fellowships will include dedicated awards for Māori and Pacific researchers.
	$37.6 million over four years will support New Zealand’s association with Horizon Europe, the European Union’s research funding programme.
	CAH folk may also be interested in the following announcements (I haven’t seen details yet but will keep you posted about relevance to us):
		$24.7 million to improve our data on both the impacts of climate change and adaptation and mitigation responses taken in New Zealand. Also $19.9 million to support resilience to climate change for iwi, hapū and the wider hapori whānui by expanding both data quality and access. This funding will ensure that these groups have the information they need to make decisions about climate change, adaptation, resource management and resilience of communities.
		$39.2 million in improving the mapping of New Zealand’s coastline and identifying coastal areas at significant risk of climate-related hazards and natural disasters. New Zealand’s people, infrastructure, and numerous environmental assets located near and on the coast are forecast to become increasingly exposed to hazards generated by climate change-induced sea-level rise and more frequent storms and surge events. This initiative will help communities, businesses and local and central government to better understand the risks, plan for and adapt to future climate hazards.
	Full details of the Budget are available here: https://budget.govt.nz/budget/pdfs/wellbeing-budget/b23-wellbeing-budget.pdf.
	Finally (and on a completely different topic), it’s a year since the National Environmental Data Centre launched at https://nedc.nz/. The site is a joint CRI initiative that is intended to provide easy access to national environmental data. Analytics show that the site receives up to 200 visitors a day and its climate datasets are among the most accessed information. Have you had a look at it yet? And are you aware of any NIWA datasets that aren’t on there? If so, please email Stacy Mohan to get them uploaded.


Science: 

Budget 2023 includes significant investments in research and development to deliver on the
Te Ara Paerangi Future Pathways reforms of our public research system, consistent with our
commitment to increase research and development expenditure to 2 percent of GDP:
* $400 million total capital and $51 million total operating for multi-institution research, science
and innovation collaboration hubs in the Wellington region focused on health and wellbeing;
oceans, climate and hazards; and advanced manufacturing, biotech and energy futures.
* $55.3 million total operating for research fellowships and an applied doctoral training
scheme, to fill skills gaps and grow a sustainable research system in New Zealand.
* $37.6 million total operating for New Zealand to associate with the European Union’s Horizon
Europe Initiative, so that our researchers can work closely with their European Union
counterparts on the big global challenges like climate change and health.
* The Research and Development Tax Incentive (RDTI) continues to provide a 15 percent tax
credit for businesses on eligible Research and Development (R&D) expenditure. In 2023, the
Government also opened applications for an in-year payments scheme. This allows businesses
to gain an interest free government loan that can be used towards R&D costs when the costs
are incurred, with the loan repayable when the corresponding RDTI credit is available.
We are also responding to New Zealand’s productivity challenge by unleashing business potential.
We will invest a further $74.7 million operating in our Industry Transformation Plans:
* $29.9 million total operating to coordinate focused services for the horticulture technology
sector, which will support sectors affected by the cyclone to develop more productive ways of
operating over time.
* $26.6 million total operating to support businesses to upskill to address digital skills gaps, and
increase women’s participation in the technology sector from 27 percent to 50 percent by 2030.
* $18.2 million total operating for implementing an accreditation system for tourism employers.

@PwC 

The Treasury estimates that the damage will total between **$9 and $14.5 billion**. This comprises $5 – $7.5 billion of damage to central and local government infrastructure (eg, transport and water), as well as losses suffered by households and businesses. **The events have also caused an estimated $400 – $600 million in output losses in the first half of 2023, primarily from lost agricultural and horticultural production**. Persistent annual losses of approximately $100 million are also anticipated beyond 2023.

==== Adaptive Futures ====

Adaptive Futures is a 'serious game' designed to introduce players to community-level decision-making and climate change adaptation. The research used to produce the game was conducted jointly through NIWA Taihoro Nukurangi and Manaaki Whenua Landcare Research, and funded by the Natural Hazards Platform. The game is programmed using the Twine platform, which combines visual and in-built coding elements with CSS and Javascript to write non-linear 'stories'. The project is published to HTML and hosted on a Github page.`

The objective of the game is to protect the Seaview community from the adverse effects of climate change. Doing this will require the player to take actions to adapt to these effects, and their ability to take action depends on support from the community. Maintaining that support means that the player will need to build trust with community members, who experience the effects of climate change differently depending on their own values and location within the coastal space. Therefore, the game requires the player to balance the wishes of the community with the need to mitigate the immediate and long-term effects of climate change.
