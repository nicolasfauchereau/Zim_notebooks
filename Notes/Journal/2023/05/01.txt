===== Python package for accessing and downloading CMIP6 database =====

https://github.com/TaufiqHassan/acccmip6

--------------------

==== ALSO: Synda ====

Synda is a command line tool to search and download files from the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) archive. Synda is a useful tool if you need to download Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) data in particular. Synda supports different download protocols (e.g. HTTPS) and can download files in parallel.

conda install -c IPSL synda

Note: 

TAS is hourly 

TASMIN and TASMAX is daily, e.g. 196002 contains 28 values

//Hi Neelesh Rampal, Peter Gibson and everyone ... I am about to start crunching BCSD on daily surface temperature and wanted to check something with you: just to be clear I need to do tas, tasmin and tasmax ? if so something bugs me and I just want to make sure: //

//tasmin and tasmax are daily values: are they aligned to UTC or the VCSN (NZ) time ? if not should I not then, rather than using these variables 'as is' calculate tasmin and tasmax from the original hourly tas values like so: //

//tasmax = tasmax.resample(time = '1D', base = 21) //

//i.e. with reference to https://one.niwa.co.nz/display/CLIDB/VCSN+Times+and+Field+Descriptions //

//please advise ðŸ™‚// 

//ThanksÂ PeterÂ Gibson, in my case it might not be as important as with Neelesh's case (I am matching distribution to distribution) ... actually now that I think about it doing what I suggest might mess things up quite a bit as it would mess up the model (CCAM)'s diurnal cycle ... but just want to have your guys' views before I crank the wheelÂ //

//and now that I really think about it, with the exception of the ERA5 forced CCAM run, instead of calculating daily precipitation asÂ //

//1)//

//Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  dset = dset.resample(time ='1D', base = 21).mean()//
//Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  dset[varname] = dset[varname] * (3600 * 24)//

//It might be worth doing just ...Â //

//2)//

//Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  dset = dset.resample(time ='1D').mean()//
//Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  dset[varname] = dset[varname] * (3600 * 24)//

//so far I have been doing 1) ... it also could have messed up CCAM's diurnal cycle ... if 2) is preferable to 1) it is not a train smash, I can redo the calibration etc ... it will just take a bit of time, but could be better ...//Â
