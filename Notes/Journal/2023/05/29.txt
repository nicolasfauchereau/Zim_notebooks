==== Economic impacts of tipping points in the climate system ====

Dietz, S., J. Rising, T. Stoerk, and G. Wagner, 2021: Economic impacts of tipping points in the climate system. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 118, e2103081118, https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2103081118.

by Dietz et al is basically nonsense, as shown by 

Keen, S., T. M. Lenton, T. J. Garrett, J. W. B. Rae, B. P. Hanley, and M. Grasselli, 2022: Estimates of economic and environmental damages from tipping points cannot be reconciled with the scientific literature. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Social tipping processes towards climate action: A conceptual framework

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921800921003013?via%3Dihub

Abstract: Societal transformations are necessary to address critical global challenges, such as mitigation of anthropogenic climate change and reaching UN sustainable development goals. Recently, social tipping processes have received increased attention, as they present a form of social change whereby a small change can shift a sensitive social system into a qualitatively different state due to strongly self-amplifying (mathematically positive) feedback mechanisms. Social tipping processes with respect to technological and energy systems, political mobilization, financial markets and sociocultural norms and behaviors have been suggested as potential key drivers towards climate action.
