Hi Tristan

In the context of the work you are doing around nowcasting / forecasting for renewable energy, I thought you would be interested in reading this paper:

 might be worth looking into this for NZ ? I have worked on a national offshore feasibility study report over the past couple of months, I know this is a serious consideration especially in the context of green H2 production, so would have to look at e.g. NZ reanalysis for wind offshore

cheers
