Their trend figure shows very strong soil moisture trends especially in the west of the South Island → very unlikely

@idea 

based on RONI ? use CCAM simulations ?

==== On rate-induced tipping points: Rate-induced tipping in complex high-dimensional ecological networks ====

Human activities are havingincreasingly negative impacts onnatural systems, and it is ofinterest to understand how the“pace” of parameter changemay lead to catastrophicconsequences. This work studiesthe phenomenon of rate-inducedtipping (R-tipping) inhigh-dimensional ecologicalnetworks, where the rate ofparameter change can cause thesystem to undergo a tippingpoint from healthy survival toextinction. **A quantitative scaling law between the probability of R-tipping and the rate was uncovered, with a striking and devastating consequence: In order to reduce the probability, parameter changes must beslowed down to such an extent that the rate practically reaches zero. This may pose an extremely significant challenge in our efforts to protect and preserve the natural environment.**

This is the opposite to what they say: In the tropics persistence is generally a good predictor ( @idea : calculate autocorrelation, e-folding time !) because of SST - atmosphere coupling.

Around Antarctica: sea-ice ... probably 

In the Pacific tropics: poor prediction in the ENSO regions ! 

Seems that they use **GraphSAGE: Inductive Representation Learning on Large Graphs**:   https://snap.stanford.edu/graphsage/
