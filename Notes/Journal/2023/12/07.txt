Funded initiatives at NIWA 

→ project (SSIF) on forecasting for preventing loss of life 
→ Nowcasting for renewable energy generation ... in conjunction with Ben Lively ... 400K of funding 


some other stuff to think about 

NZRA: is that already available ?

Graphcast 
MetNet3 

doing away with assimilation (expensive) and focus on obs instead of reanalyses. Initialisation 

SUB-SEASONAL FORECASTING

Catherine De Burgh-Day: focus on subseasonal forecasting 


NOWCASTING 


report / paper that shows the financial impacts of insufficient forecasts (persistence!) in the renewable energy sector and the added value of nowcasting ... look for that open-source project ? 

NZX. Market info on hydro provided to NZX 

collab with generators 


ISSUES 

Vertical velocity issues in the forecasts, not adequately represented. Neelesh's work in ablation studies has shown that omega has a disproportionate impact 

downscaling is rendered difficult because physical inconsistencies
