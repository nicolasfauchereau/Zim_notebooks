===== ideas around UNSUPERVISED PRE-TRAINING =====

We have a relatively small independent **labelled** dataset, but we can access **a large dataset of unlabelled instances**: i.e T2M, PRECIP and Z500 fields coming from e.g. long-term reanalyses or CMIP models ... **possibility to first used unsupervised pre-training** (see p 349 in Hands-On ML2, https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2)
