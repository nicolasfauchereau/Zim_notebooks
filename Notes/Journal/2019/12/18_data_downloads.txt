==== download T2M: downloading, on 19 December up to 2013-10 (UKMO, MF, DWD, CMCC, ECMWF) ====

 
	[*] restart from 2013-01: log in lauch_log.txt (/home/nicolasf/research/Smart_Ideas/code/exporters/CDS) 
		[*] ECMWF: ok all 12 months per year downloaded in [[/home/nicolasf/research/Smart_Ideas/data/GCMs/GRIB/ECMWF/T2M]]
		[*] UKMO: years 1993 to 2006 only include 11 months: missing all Januarys
						
						NOTE: one can download the missing files using the CDS download form, but there are some issues with READING the files using xarray
						
						The **solution** seems to be to specify the **longitude of the first grid point in degree to be 0.5 (to match all other files)**: 
						
						e.g.
						
						dset_01 = xr.open_dataset(f'/home/nicolasf/research/Smart_Ideas/data/GCMs/GRIB/UKMO/{var_name}/UKMO_system_12_13_14_{var_name}_1994_01.grib', engine='cfgrib', \
											   **backend_kwargs={"indexpath":"", 'filter_by_keys':{'longitudeOfFirstGridPointInDegrees': 0.5}**
											**}**)
						
						Note that despite the error: 
						
						ECCODES ERROR   :  Unable to find template localDefinition from grib1/local.98.12.def 
						
						The dataset is indeed opened 
						
						see in notebook [[/home/nicolasf/research/Smart_Ideas/code/pre-processors/notebooks/CDS/fix_UKMO_Missing_Januarys_forecasts.ipynb]] 
						
						NOTE: [[/home/nicolasf/research/Smart_Ideas/code/pre-processors/notebooks/CDS/fix_UKMO_Missing_Januarys_forecasts.ipynb]] re-downloading the Januarys foprecasts 
						from 1994 to 2006 included: it seems that it's OK NOT TO SPECIFY THE SYSTEM, e.g. request API call looks like:
