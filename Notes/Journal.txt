==== Meeting MBIE Endeavour with Drew ====

Hi Andrew & Nico,

Here are the notes from our meeting â€“ feel free to add to these:

Action Points:

	Drew to send us the internal proposal so that we have a bit more context.
	Nico & Neelesh to set up initial meeting, and discuss relevant literature to the proposal preferably by the end of the month.
	Chat with Chen Wang (DS at NIWA), for relevant literature on sensor placement.


Research / Discussion Points:

	Leveraging AI/ ML for optimal placement of sensors, are there particular locations where we can position our Tier 1 sensors, so that they best capture variability in a given region.
	Development of an optimization problem (e.g. for K number of sensors and X dollars per sensor, what is the best positioning of the sensors)
	Leveraging re-enforcement learning, optimization research and other clustering algorithms to determine the optimal placement of sensors (similar to point 1). Positioning of Tier 2 sensors over a short fixed period.
	Using AI/ML to re-calibrate Tier 2 sensors, that they have similar quality to Tier 1 sensors. 

Cheers,

Neelesh.
